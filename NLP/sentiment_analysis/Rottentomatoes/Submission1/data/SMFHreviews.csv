Review
One of the best movies I've ever seen ‚úåüèæüî•
Great movie with cool visual effects and good performances.
"this movie is slept on hard, i rated it a 1 becayuse in no earth is this better thana avengers infinity wars and endgame"
A Sequel After Spider-Man: Homecoming Is Actually Great!!
A Sequel After Spider-Man: Homecoming is Actually Great!
"I love Mysterio getting mainstream attention, how it adresses some of the issues Peter and the rest of the world would go through after the events of Endgame and the action."
A fun vacation movie mixed with teenage superhero shenanigans. A fun movie that still progresses the overarching narrative of this universes Spider-Man. A bit too simple in some ways for my liking but definitely not a bad watch.
"Not bad at all, but it has a slight feeling of being rushed story wise, with most of the plot bouncing from place to place as much as the cast does on their trip. The fun and creative villains add a lot to the film, as does the balance between humor and tension."
"The start of this movie is slow, but once it gets going, it keeps going right till the end, the second half of the movie is some of the best Spider-Man we've ever gotten."
"O filme √© legal, mas acho que desperdi√ßaram o Mist√©rio."
Oh filme ruim cara esse filme com certeza e muito ruim ou talvez e o pior filme do homem aranha mais eu n√£o acho por causa que tem cena dahora e o Mysterio tamb√©m e um vil√£o muito legal
***SPOILERS***

"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun and enjoyable movie, with a predictable story except for the ending."
""
"The established characters are great, but the new ones, not so much. I like Peter more and more, while Happy is at his best. He had a lot of great and funny moments in this movie. Mysterio is flat to me. I knew he was going to be the villain and his intentions are simple and dumb. What he does in the end angers me, I don't like where the story is going. The story is okay, the beginning with a tribute to Tony Stark is really touching. Although as I said, I didn't really like where it was going from there."
""
"The visual effects look flawless, the pacing is good, the cinematography too. The cast is great. Tom Holland, who has become my favourite Spider-Man since the last movie, gave a terrific performance, while both Jon Favreau and Jake Gyllenhaal are really great too."
""
"Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun and predictable, but there's a twist at the end and I don't like where that's going."
"For the sophomore release of the newest Spiderman Movies, this Movie definitely expands upon the first movie with New Villains, New Characters (And Old!) and does so amazingly, Its a Must Watch for anyone new to the franchise or has watched Homecoming!"
cutesy Peter. the whole movie is awesome & fun
"N√£o √© o pior filme do mundo, mas n√£o me marcou."
"Lo peor que eh visto de spiderman, arruina todo el personaje ya estructurado en ""Spider-man: homecoming"""
"The MCU continues on with Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man‚Äôs next installment. As Peter tries to distance himself from the role of Spider-Man for a while whilst grieving, he finds himself in an even more dangerous situation when his emotions are manipulated and he is spread thin amongst his classmates, SHIELD, and a possible new hero who calls himself ‚ÄúMysterio‚Äù. The movie shows this Peter Parker off in a new fashion without relying on the ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù personality, which shows to be both a blessing and a curse in this film. His classmates are the high points as the movie tries to find an emotional maturity in Peter which, at times, are the low points of the film. However, I would not say that they did bad at this film, it was very enjoyable and the ensemble surrounding Peter is very entertaining. It makes for a really fun movie that lays the groundwork for Spider-Man‚Äôs greatest challenge yet."
"A very fun Spiderman sequel with some good bittersweet subplots that serve as an epilog to the Aftermath of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Peter's relationship with MJ is sweet and there‚Äôs a nice dynamic without Happy Hogan across the film. The Euro trip setting is a nice change of pace. Mysterio's twist is pretty good and feels comic accurate. Some of the humor and implications about Tony Stark can get a bit iffy in the middle, but the movie makes up for it with its sweet climax and terrific cliffhanger ending."
Better than homecoming
"Una pelicila entretenida, divertida y con mucha acci√≥n."
A great epilogue to Avengers Endgame and a truly great Spider-Man movie in its own right.
Clap clap clap this was good
"Spider-Man is my favorite childhood comic book. I read many story arcs from the 70s to 90s. This movie felt like one of those story arcs. I liked how it linked in to the Spider-verse movie, and it actually managed to make me like the old Sony versions of Spider-Man while explaining thier existance."
""
"Very well crafted and acted, I liked Zedaya in the role as MJ. The villain was fine and really served to set up the next film. Knowing who the character was from the books left a lot of the setup flat, but it was still pretty good anyway - especially seeing the illusions play out as new versions of sandman and hydro, for instance."
""
A good lead into the finale for this SM trilogy.
"Great spider-man movie. I liked Mysterio and the whole conspiracy that he was a hero. It got confusing at some points, but was still great. I would give it A 70%"
"It was a perfect movie for the summer! I couldn't help but applaud when Peter and MJ's love blossomed! It was cool to see him face various difficulties!Mysterio's betrayal was also portrayed in a wonderful way, and he was a really good villain! It was really fun!"
loved it amazing way to do a sequel honestly i don't even have to say more
Its good fun. The holographic was a new villain concept.
The best from the tom holland spiderman movies.
"Ok, the First one was better"
"Another winning installment in this formula driven franchise, only this time the action takes place all over Europe.  Keep a look-out for our newest superhero - ""the Night Monkey!""  I especially enjoyed the romantic subplot (with Zendaya) in this one."
Dire√ß√£o: Ok
Atua√ß√£o: Bom
Roteiro: Ok
Caracteriza√ß√£o: Bom
Soundtrack: Ok
"Probably my favourite out of the three Spider-Man performances from Tom Holland, thoroughly enjoyable and equally thrilling."
"This movie has great potential for an epic sci-fi superhero action, just like other spiderman movies were, but this one is a nonsense."
"My favorite of the Tom Holland Spider man films and in my top 10 favorite MCU movies! The action is must more intense. I care about Peter Parker‚Äôs arc about wanting to spend more time with his friends than his super hero work, Mysterio is one of my favorite MCU villains of all time, and the stakes are very high! It‚Äôs really fun!"
Ahh man i can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶tom holland is cool ngl
Spiderman battles Mysterio!
"A film that clearly has great potential, but that gets lost and suffocated in the narrow path of the Marvel universe."
This Is Really Good
I think it actually sucked a little bit more than the first one
It's hard to tell when comparing equal sized piles of garbage
81/100 I hated that Mysterio was a fluke.
"With the help of Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio, 'Far From Home' stands a solid Spider-man movie with tons of fun and a nice mix-up from the usual material."
A refreshing watch after 100 sessions of watching endgame
"Non √® un brutto film. Il villain di Mysterio non mi ha preso molto, perch√© si parla di un cattivo che vuole diventare il prossimo iron man dopo gli eventi di Endgame ma alla fine si rivela essere intelligente e apprezzabile. L‚Äôatmosfera √® un po‚Äô distorta ma accettabile. Ci mostra come un adolescente debba prendersi le sue responsabilit√† di eroe dopo la morte di Tony Stark. Infatti Peter vuole godersi i suoi momenti felici ma un cattivo lo costringe a portare avanti la sua eredit√†. Le conseguenzialita di Peter sarebbero venute a galla prima o poi. Con un esilarante avventura il tono viene allargato, facendoti credere che anche un supereroe molto giovane pu√≤  avere i suoi problemi di stanchezza. Lo scontro finale devo dire che √® stato incredibile. 8/10"
"It's a very weak movie and this is the worst version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in theaters, Mysterio is a great villain and the final fight is very good."
"This film is great due to its light story and comedic acting. With all of the silly Ned love stuff and the power range type villains , it still feels like a hero movie with high stakes. This film can be watched just a few times before you go like ‚Äú urghh this again‚Äù but it is great to have on when your tired or when you need something in the background. Great film üçø"
It‚Äôs a really good movie.
i like watch all cast
"an excellent film with excellent direction, for a moment I was a child again"
"This rendition of Mysterio was freaking badass, I love how with classic Spiderman villains they take them and modernize them with their powers based off of technology and that is amazing, whole movie was really really good, I was left real satisfied with it."
"This movie has a few flaws,but I think is not that bad"
Interesting that we got to see Spider-Man in an European setting. Mysterio seems interesting with illusion tech
Not the best follow up to the MCU Spider-Man. Mysterio was an odd choice for the villain and didn‚Äôt showcase his true powers like in the books. Must watch to understand the next movie though.
"Although I don't think it's as good as Spiderman No Way Home, it doesn't mean that the movie isn't good."
"Also, no matter how much I think about it, I don't find any major flaws, the first part may be a little slow, but Mysterio is a very good villain."
"This sequel improves on its predecessor, making this a hilarious film that is both a sick superhero movie and a great romance story."
"Far from home is even better than the first film. Don't doubt it at all! With more beautiful action sequences, a special visual style, a wonderful villain that is one of the best in the MCU, and... this movie is the best medicine for the sadness of the endgame movie, and the best ending. For the epic is eternity."
"This movie makes the best use of the interaction between the characters, and its biggest strength is its script, which has grown in all aspects compared to the movie."
This movie shows a beautiful and painful romance. Just what we wanted! But there is no sequence or dialogue to show the love of Peter and MJ in the movie.
I wanted this movie to use characters like Molten Man or Hydro Man or Chamaleon better and not waste their potential.
"The change of Peter's character was strange to me. In the first movie, he preferred being a hero to school, but in this movie it is the opposite. He leaves New York, which is the birthplace of various villains!"
"However, these flaws do not diminish the value of this movie and it is the best continuation for one of the best MCU movies. Just watch and enjoy."
9 out of 10
"One of the most boring movie ever, there some cool thing bat it's not too good"
"Far From Home gets better as it goes on, and features the best villain in one of these since Spider-Man 2, but the cracks at the foundation for this iteration of the Spider-Man franchise are visible. Even if the central theme of truth-versus-deception is compelling, the focus on character that elevated Homecoming is less clear, and the ensemble seems to be settling into autopilot."
Has its moments but overall doesnt justify its existence. Whats worse is that it turns out its all pointless.  Spider-Man shouldnt be in this world with other bigger heroes. Rather a complete reboot (no I dont think we need yet another one) than continuing this Spider-Man in this Avengers world.
Keep Brining Them Back üôè
The best Tom Holland Spider-Man movie in my opinion! Comedy and action all the way through the film!
3 Spidermen are better than one.
It‚Äôs good but there‚Äôs something about it that brings it down a little that I can‚Äôt quite shoot a web at. Nonetheless still a great time.
Completely unfaithful to Spider-Man‚Äôs character. They made him an unlikable moron in this movie.
"One of the best Spiderman sequels we have gotten. I felt like it was time marvel released another Spiderman movie and they definitely delivered. The CGI was amazing, I would say I would have loved to see more practical effects as there was plenty of room for those to be added, as well as plenty of budget. The story was really well done and had the perfect amounts of twists and turns without it being overwhelming. The acting is actually really well done as I feel when studios start to get to this point they start to focus to much on the action and not enough on the characters. There were a few moments that let them shine. The actors really brought them to life, it does help that you have two of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment. All in all a really good Spiderman movie."
Fantastic movie I would definitely watch this again but I feel like it‚Äôs too focused on the death of iron man and not really focus on Spider-Man‚Äôs growth in not relying on Tony
My favorite MCU movie by far! The story feels just like school and the characters are really relatable. Mysterio was portrayed perfectly and the visual effects were above and beyond. Highly recommend watching this!
"Esse √© o meu favorito do homem Aranha,e seriamente,nem tenho que explicar,ele √© perfeito em todos os quesito,mas eu acho ele maneiro mais por conta de todos os plots sabe?"
"80/100 - good movie, predictable, but a good all around film. it definitely appeals to a wide audience, pretty cookie cutter. obviously it has a lot of corny bs but you cant have something too edgy without alienating a large audience which is why they made this. a blend of genres that works as a family film, a comedy, drama, and action film."
"I love the direction the new installments of Spider-Man are taking. Tom Holland was the right man for this role, he is Spider-Man. This movie was clever and well thought out. The visuals are stunning and the movement of the age-old Peter and MJ was excellent."
"I'm a spider-man fan, but this movie was just so mid, very disappointing for a movie that is spider-man."
"This movie is entertaining and funny while delivering crazy and explosive action that is showcased well. The film is very emotional at times and surprisingly has some horror sequences and scary visuals when it comes to the villain. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is good at building suspense. A fun ride that delivers great performances from the entire cast, Tom holland is likeable as spiderman, Zendaya is great as MJ, Samuel L Jackson is good as Nick Fury as usual and Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as Mysterio. Not the best Spiderman movie but overall a entertaining Spidey adventure worth watching."
Tiene m√°s acci√≥n los efectos de los elementos son incre√≠bles la historia est√° bien echa
All I can say is wow. What an amazing storyline. The action was amazing and I could watch it over and over again.
Tom Holland's Spider-Man is just a fun time every time
"Endgame hangover movie, weak spidey movie."
Muito bom! Recomendo muito esse filme.
"Segue a linha e mant√©m a boa qualidade do primeiro filme, mas carregando os mesmos pontos negativos."
I liked this movie alot I felt that Mysterio wasnt real and I guess they did a good job following the story line. but this movie is defiently a link to the marvel movies that come after! definetlly a different feeling from the original Marvel Characters and feel of movies. but overall an entertaining movie
"While I would probably rank this overall toward the middle or upper-middle of the Marvel movies I've seen, it's one of the more purely fun and joyful films in the franchise. It reminded me more than once of SUPERMAN II (1980), which is my favorite superhero movie of all time. Perhaps it had to do with references to the Eiffel Tower, where SUPERMAN II took place in its opening scenes. What I was missing was a sense of danger and tension that I experienced in some of the other movies. I felt like too much time was devoted to Peter's high school class, and it felt like more of a distraction from the story than an enhancement. Gyllenhaal is my favorite working actor, and he does well here, but I can't say I'd rank Mysterio among my favorite Marvel villains. And I must be honest - I'm having trouble warming up to Zendaya as M.J. in these movies. I didn't like her in THE GREATEST SHOWMAN either, so maybe I just have issues with her as an actress. All that aside, though, this is a lot of fun and probably one of the more family friendly Marvel movies that will entertain all ages."
9.4/10
"This was a very superior sequel in the Tom Holland Spider-Man series! I loved Mysterio, he's a great villain! The Blip event did confuse me a bit, but it didn't ruin my thoughts on the film. The action scenes were great, special effects are top-notch, and the cast nailed it again!"
"In my opinion this movie is fairly rated at 90% i would say it's probably 85% but 90 is close enough.I personally think that homecoming was better and this movie was really good at sending the message of Peter getting better at balancing his life with his responsibilities of being a superhero and i enjoyed the change of scenery as the students go to different countries.But personally i think the villain was just boring and unoriginal,It was a good idea just executed wrong.But yeah the ending was good kinda bugged that i didn't enjoy this movie as much as homecoming"
"It's a film that's fun to come back to every few months, but not that often."
"Second Spider-Man movie is really good, 90-94%"
fun action movie well done
"Best of the Tom Holland Spider-Man films. Mysterio casting, storyline, and special effects were great. This is the only Tom Holland Spider-Man film I rewatch occasionally."
"This is definitely not the worst Spider Man film, it's was amazing like all Spider Man movies, but this one was sadly the weakest Tom Holland films."
"One of my favorite Spider-Man movies, if I'm honest it's cause I'm biased. Growing up and to this day Mysterio is my favorite Spidey villain of all time and just seeing him in live action and done super well makes me so happy that I can ignore (most of) the negative aspects of this film"
still love mister holland
Forced more Iron Man into Spider-Man's villain's backstory. Mysterio was also very cheesy. Only positive I can say is about the special effects being well done.
"He's just a little boy, let his bridge and love burn"
"Picking up where¬†Avengers: Endgame¬†left off,¬†Spider-Man: Far From Home¬†sees Peter Parker having to adapt to a world minus the guidance of mentor Tony Stark as he goes on a European school trip, ghosting Nick Fury along the way, in the hope of prioritizing his own life for once but new threats and a ""mysterious"" new hero disturbs his plans."
""
"The film opens with an amusingly tacky tribute to Tony Stark and Captain America, setting the playful tone for this post-Avengers adventure. The film focuses quite a bit on Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his high school friends as they all travel to Europe where Peter, who initially even left his Spidey-suit (and Peter Tingle) behind, plans to buy MJ (Zendaya) a gift and ask her out. Of course, this proves to be a lot more difficult than Peter anticipated as Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up to hire him for a new mission, which he politely declines at first yet can't quite get away from."
""
"The mission in question involves the Elementals, a handful of giants who can control Air, Earth, Fire and Water, starting to pop up in random places all over the world. As it turns out, Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), a new hero claiming to be coming from a different Multiverse, has been working with S.H.I.E.L.D. to defend the Earth against the Elementals who destroyed his world."
""
"As part of Tony Stark's last wishes, Nick Fury hands Stark's glasses, containing powerful A.I. tech network E.D.I.T.H. over to Peter, and the latter struggles to handle the great power and responsibility he was taught go hand in hand. As the Elementals and Beck (aka Mysterio) go head to head and Beck almost dies trying to save the world, a disillusioned Peter decides to hand over E.D.I.T.H. to him and the film takes a perhaps not-all-that unexpected but still enjoyably off-road turn."
""
Spoilers ahead so there's still time to see the film and come back to this review.
""
"Ok, so of course Mysterio turns out to not be what he seems as Beck is revealed to be an ex-employee of Tony Stark's who designed holographic technology only to then be fired for being deemed unstable. He and other Stark enemies joined forces to create realistic illusions in the hope of leading up to a fake Avengers-level threat created using E.D.I.T.H., one which Mysterio could then pretend to extinguish thereby becoming the most powerful ""hero"" on Earth. Spider-Man is, therefore, forced to deal with not only his inner demons and insecurities but the phoney (yet deadly) demons laid out by his deceitful foe (or ""faux"", rather)."
""
"Far From Home feels a bit like a full-length spin-off of the Washington school trip sequence from¬†Spider-Man: Homecoming¬†with a very different kind of villain at the heart of it. The light-hearted charm of Homecoming is very much intact here. In fact, there's a lot more of it to the point where one wonders if there's maybe a little too much. The high-school cast is as likable as ever and the humor is entertaining but it does tend to distract from the darker, more emotional themes of the film, and its interesting yet frankly underwritten villain."
""
"Mysterio is both the best thing about this sequel and the biggest missed opportunity. As impressive as the villain's illusions are and as good as Jake Gyllenhaal is in the role, you can't help but feel that less time could have been spent repeating jokes (the MJ/Peter/Brad love triangle, the goofy teachers, Ned and his new girlfriend) to allow for more character development. Instead of Mysterio dumping all of his backstory in one single ranty scene, perhaps spreading this throughout the movie in a clever way could have elevated him to the best Spider-Man villain in any live-action film thusfar."
""
"While it does feel like the Far From Home script could have done with, perhaps, one or two more drafts trimming the fat and fleshing out some characters and parts of the plot, this remains a thoroughly enjoyable ride from start to finish. The action scenes could have easily felt generic due to the personality-free nature of the Elementals but they are one of this film's biggest strengths. Whenever Spidey and Mysterio are on screen, either working together or fighting it out, the film shines and delivers exactly the kind of Summer popcorn entertainment we all signed up for."
""
"Tom Holland's wide-eyed Peter Parker is every bit as charming as he was the first or second time around (if you count Civil War) and Spider-Man's character arc, though it includes some surprisingly dumb decisions along the way, sets up the next film perfectly, especially thanks to a couple of nifty post-credits reveals."
""
"Spider-Man: Homecoming might have been the better film thanks to a more balanced and overall more coherent script but Far From Home delivers the thrills, laughs and twists you'd expect from a Marvel blockbuster and it does so with gusto, charm and some bold moves. Armed with a genuinely cool villain, a fantastic score by Michael Giacchino and slick visuals, this one may be Far From Home but it's not far from great."
""
A lot of fun.
Terrible movie its not a Spider-Man movie in my opinion. Peter is just a fanboy and iron boy of Tony Stark (Iron-Man) even his villains are basically Iron-Man villains. And the jokes isn't very funny.
"A great movie, it's kinda weird, and the ending with mysterio is not great. If you can handle that, you should enjoy it"
That's overhated. I very liked that movie. Post credit scene was great
"yeah, I'm not really a big fan of this movie"
"I really liked this movie, love Tom Holland as Spider-Man and loved the travel across Europe. Jake Gyllenhall was a great villain and Zendaya and the one who plays Ned were great as well. Spider-Man is always cool and that ending that set up No Way Home was great. Great Spider-Man movie, better than Homecoming in my opinion."
Me gusta pel√≠cula est√° genial el nuevo teje de Spider-Man la acci√≥n es incre√≠ble la batalla final me encant√≥ mu √©pica
Funniest spider man movie
"Twist was expected, and story is badly executed."
"This film improves on the first, with even more action, more humor and more heart, and while it has a more serious tone than Homecoming, it's still more fun and interesting to follow."
"One of the most underrated MCU and Spider-Man movies. I think this movie's rotten tomatoes scores are good, but I cannot see why many people don't like this. The action is spectacular, the characters are great, the villain was amazing, and the end credits scenes, particularly the first one, were amazing. 9/10."
A good follow-up that retains the MCU's trademark silliness while changing up the lightheartedness of Spider-Man Homecoming.
"You might think this is a joke, but its not, this movie, is the worst piece of $h!+ I have ever seen! I hate this movie with a passion!This movie has nothing good about it.I hate ""mysterio"" so much,but my main problem is with Tom Holland, He in my opinion is my least favorite Spider-Man ever! He can't properly display who Spider-Man is to me.He's just not that guy and its why other then his third movie, his series is my least favorite by far, And this film, is definitely, not ""Amazing""!"
Tom Holland is my Spider Man <3
"The better version of Homecoming, I feel that the plot twists really make this movie so much better, and the Night Monkey Variant of the suit is really awesome!"
A fun action-packed adventure with our spidey. The villain presents a mental psychological threat for peter as he must figure out which is real and which isnt. A lovable supporting cast follow peter every step in the way including a secret cameo from a fan favourite.
"This was a really good Spider-Man film people overhate this movie because of the McGuffin that Tony Stark gives Spider-Man and yes, they did feel very forest, awkward but it‚Äôs sets our character into having responsibility as a superhero this is a fun movie, and he feels like a comedy superhero indie film. Mysterio is really good in the promotion for this movie feel like he‚Äôs going to have grand steaks with introducing the elementals, but the fact that Mysterio speaking people with advanced technology, and making people se that Mysterio is the hero of the story was really really good. The suits was very good the action movie with good. Every character was funny and to meet us had a lot of weight because coming off of endgame you had high expectations for this movie and it succeeded There‚Äôs a lot of twist and turns that no one expected from this movie Mysterio‚Äôs whole motivation is fame and relevancy and I thought that was a good change for a very cool villain and like in no way home the only problem that I had was that Peter was not active and then he became active throughout the story but here in this movie peter is active all the way through the movie, his choices is pushing the story and that was really good. Overall a really good movie, and I wish phase 4 kept  the same approach, but it did not 8.5/10"
"Far from Home effortlessly blends the greater MCU narrative with a compelling character story. Zendaya and Holland keep the drama at a sweet high while mind-warping special effect scenes keep a you guessing what is actually happening. Cliffhanger ending included, this is a very satisfying film."
Se que en esta pel√≠cula arribaron al personaje de spiderman pero fuera de eso es una buena pel√≠cula misterio es un muy gran villano y los efectos son muy buenos.
Est√° pel√≠cula est√° muy infravalorada
"D√ºnyayƒ± kurtarmƒ±yor, mahallemizin kahramanƒ± tanƒ±mƒ±na tam uyan bir kahraman. Oyunculuk olsun, senaryo olsun, g√∂rsellik olsun, espriler, diyaloglar g√ºzel olmu≈ü. Beƒüenerek izledim."
Overrated but Mysterio is fire
"Totally soulless movie, without memorable scenes, without character evolution, and as if that weren't enough, Peter Parker has a big setback of maturity compared to the first film. One of the worst."
"Easily a step up from its predecessor! Mysterio killed it! Loved the chemistry between Peter and MJ! Great third act and post credit scenes. I liked how it took place in europe, giving Spider-Man a vacation."
"Um filme meia boca, com cenas bastante for√ßadas, tendo como exemplo, o amor sem contexto nenhum do Peter e Mj e at√© o hype do multiverso por meio do Mist√©rio, al√©m de uma grande bobaliza√ß√£o do homem aranha, que s√≥ fala do tony stark, o que salva s√£o as cenas de a√ß√£o (principalmente a do final do filme), EU esperava mais"
Great Spider-Man movie and definitely overhated. Saw it in theaters and rewatched it 2 times. Great movie as always. In the beginning I was skeptical about Mysterio but they really fooled me. It's fun seeing Peters love life to MJ in the movie.
"Garbage if it wasn't for Samuel Jackson, I switched off after 30min."
"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't anything super special or a real achievement compared to some earlier MCU masterpieces, but it's a good time and a good sequel."
A good movie to set Spider-Man as an Avanger level hero.
A fantastic Sequel for Spider-Man in the MCU! Loved the Vacation theme to this! This is a great way to end Phase 3 and the Infinity Saga of the MCU while setting up Phase 4 and beyond!
good movie but one problem I have with it is how a lot of things arent mentioned until the end.  Still an amazing movie and I loved it
Not the best Tom Holland Spiderman movie. Less humour than I would have liked. The action scenes take up maybe 90% of the film and whilst they are amazing it is too much for my liking. I prefer a bit more story in my films.
spider man deserves a tony award for best hero movie of the year
He was in infinity war and endgame but now he's back in spider man far from home and let me tell you what this movie was really good.
This movie is great. Mysterio is a great villain and Tom Holland excels as Spider-Man once again. I always enjoy watching this film.
"Spider-Man: Far From Home takes Peter Parker on a globe-trotting adventure, blending superhero action with teenage drama, providing a fitting epilogue to Phase 3."
Fucking hate that Tom Holland prick
""
"Sincerely,"
The real Batman
"This film is seen as the odd one out amongst Tom Holland's Marvel Cinematic Universe Trilogy for it's extra-sprinkled CGI, And the Unique concept being away from the city he knows, Which is a reoccurring pattern in the second movies of trilogies from other spider men alike. The cast plays their characters flawlessly. But some plot diversions feel a little forced. The overall Theme and concept has been executed very well. I wish i could give wiggle room to rate this higher but the overall cinematography doesn't feel as pronounced and depth-full as it's ancestor and it's predecessor. Nothing makes or takes away or stands out of very good nor very good. In retrospect i would say this movie is Above average, But by a little smidge."
"it's a good movie, very enjoyable, but ridiculous overhated. this movie definitely showed how tom's spiderman is growing as a hero"
This movie is good super overhated but it still not as good as the other spider man films but Jake Gyllinhaal as mysterio was awesome
"Another exciting Spidey adventure. Mysterio is a great villain, and the after-credit scenes are the greatest and most jaw-dropping after-credit scenes I've ever seen from Marvel."
I love Spider-Man. And it turns out that this is my favorite spiderman.
"This may not be the best MCU Spider-Man movie, but it‚Äôs still a good movie."
It's cgi special effects and story are very very well done peter and Michelle's relationship is very beautiful and mysterio is a good villain üëè
"This Spiderman mixes a fair amount of action packed battle sequences and teen romance. While I do wish the film was set in New York so it has that ""Spiderman"" vibe, I had a great time with the film and the only nitpick I have with it is the villain and his plan."
I really wanna give this a better score but I dont understand why tony stark left very expensive glasses to a teenager
I thought that the plot twist alone was worth 5 stars. Never saw it coming
great spider man movie nothing else to say LOL
Filme p√©ssimo em cgi tem q aprender com dc
"A movie that I think it will be memorable for the villain,cgi and saying that's a fun movie, but only that, because it's one of the worst movies of Spider-Man that I never seen, the characters,the jokes it's like Disney channel Tv series, and many scenes that are pure comedy without sense, and they go back again and there's not a type of advance with the other movies, a very bad gion, it's a fun movie to see but many of the jokes in the movie are silly jokes, and the relation with Peter and MJ doesn't like to much in this movie, I like the upgrade suit and other things, again Tom Holland is a good actor but he could stand out more on the screen, this movie it's almost an insult to Spider-Man."
"A dull, poorly written movie, that for me is one of the poorest in the MCU."
I really enjoyed it watching it the first time but u can't rewatch it that often like the other because this is the one movie that gets to boring if u rewatch it I still think  this is a real good movie with a great concept
"Spider Man: Far From Home was okay, not one of the best Spider Man Movies."
This Spider-Man movie was watchable with likable characters and sometimes imaginative
"Great, unpredictable plot, great actors. Everything in this movie is just awesome"
one of the best marvel movies ever
Probably one of the most underrated spider-man stories the jokes were hitting and mysterio was great even though he doesn't have a real suit
"This is the ""European Vacation"" of Spider-Man movies, and I'm totally cool with that!"
Another great masterpiece from the MCU. Mysterio is one of my favourite MCU characters thanks to this movie. MCU Spider-Man has an amazingly bright future ahead of him.
"Muy buena pel√≠cula, gran actor"
Far From Home is completely Trash it's Like the First  one just a lot Worst Don't Watch it
"Much better than homecoming, Far From Home really stands out from the rest of the franchise"
Spider-man Far From Home is an improvement over its predecessor it again has great casting decisions.
"'Far From Home' is a good sequel (not the best amongst the Spider-Man ones), unfortunately it isn't as good as the first one."
Except the story line the movie was good. The origin of Mysterio is too weak and felt stretched. But the adventures of Peter Parker are good.
It was a decent movie. I think it would've been much better if Mysterio actually came from space with actual powers
"Es una pel√≠cula de superh√©roes decente, pero no una gran pel√≠cula de Spider-Man. Es muy meh y mezclaron varios puntos de la trama con tramas secundarias molestas, varias im√°genes creativas geniales y un gran villano y obtienes una pel√≠cula de Spider-Man un poco decepcionante y no genial."
As of all Spiderman movies this is a masterpiece of a movie. A great story great acting everything perfect a must see.
Spiderman goes on a class trip to Europe and meets Mysterio the villain.
Misterio salva la pel√≠cula
great movie not much to say about it.
New adventure for spider-man ...üî•
üëçgreat movie
"Muchos Fallos De Gu√≠on, Muchos Errores , No Me gusto el desarrollo de peter, Misterio es lo mejor de la pel√≠cula"
"A fun , relaxing, refreshing movie after the events of Endgame . Only minus - Spidey could have been used better.  Overall a "" Mysterious "" Mysterio - vibe movie with Spidey's biggest nightmare revealed ."
"LOL, the funniest 02 hours: and 09 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a fun time with likable characters, awkward teenage romance, and an antagonist who looks like he's having the time of his life."
"This movie is good because its plot brings news to superhero movies, this time Spider-Man just wants to enjoy his vacation and is basically obliged to go save the world. Far From Home has an excellent antagonist, good comedy, and a satisfying young love story."
great sequel to the mcu spider trilogy
this movie was good but stupid dumb story line
good and great and cool
I really like this movie and the comedy of him trying to work the Edith AI was good. I didn't like as much however how they portrayed Misterio as a disgruntled former employee of Tony Stark. That said I really enjoyed it.
Kind of a weird follow up to endgame by a great follow up to Spider-Man homecoming. This movie has the humor the emotion and entertainment value 9/10
"The acting is really good across the board. Once Nick & Mysterio arrive the acting takes a big step up and stays there. Holland is even better here and has great chemistry with MJ. Mysterio is the weakest part and is a decent villain but the backstory is really farfetched and kind of eye rolling. J.G. gives a good performance though. The humor is really good throughout as well giving it lots of charm. The cinematography is a step up from Homecoming, this feels much more like a Superhero movie. The fights while still heavily CGI are much more imaginative here and creative and creative justifying it. The camerawork is good and the settings are much more memorable. The only downside is the plot twist which has to be explained in a long 2 minute expose dump for it to make sense and sometimes it gets really farfetched like how do a million drones not land one hit on Spider-Man, No one seeing him jump out of the bus roof to stop the drone, Mysterio sets to kill them on the bridge but lets them get away, and a bunch of other little scenes like it on top of the major plot twist. The editing is really good and is a step above Homecoming, now that we've settled in this flows much better between the teen drama comedy and the super hero action and is majority superhero. This knows more what it wants to be. That leads to a very well paced film as well that is only interrupted by the plot twist of Mysterio. I'm sorry but all these background supporting characters who appeared for not even 5 seconds in previous films are now part of a major plot to take revenge with a super villain?!?! It is so farfetched and is the one thing that holds this back from being great. The saving grace is the film is clearly aware of that and never takes itself too seriously with it's story. The fact that despite that plot twist hiccup that everything else is still so well done is a testament to the direction and acting quality making everything else so charming and creative that it shines through nonetheless and manages to improve on Homecoming. I also think it benefits that its not trying to also juggle lacking an origin story as well like Homecoming was. Overall it's a Classic Superhero Action Movie and anyone who is a fan of Superheroes, Action, or any actors in this will love this. It's a lot of fun despite its plot twist which most will easily be able to look past. This is just a tick below Spider-Man 2 as the all time great Spider-Man film. (Pre No Way Home)"
The movie was good overall. Maybe not the best spider man movie for Tom but I did enjoy it.
"What is the world like after the 5 year ""blip""? How is everyone (especially Peter) dealing with Iron Man's death? Is Peter going to start pursuing MJ? All of these questions and more are explored in another great entry in the newest Spider-Man trilogy. In the MCU, there is a tendency for the second sequels to drop off significantly in value (other than The Winter Soldier). While I do not see Far From Home as better than Homecoming, it still did a great job of introducing the post-blip world and showing the strain that has fallen upon Peter Parker since Tony's sacrifice. That being said, Mysterio was predictable, the illusions got confusing and the sheer number of drones attacking Spider-Man in the third act were a little excessive. Complaints aside, the simple moment of Peter and Happy hovering in the jet over a tulip field, while reflecting on missing Tony, brought a depth to the film at just the right time. Seeing Peter struggle, yet naturally, fall into Tony's shoes sets the tone for the next phase of the MCU."
Muito bom. Mostra como o Homem-Aranha reagiu com os acontecimentos de Ultimato.
Tom Holland is just the worst Spidey I've ever seen in my life.
"Tom Holland is a great actor, but i don't think there is anybody that could carry this nonsense. The story is a series of coincidences that somehow despite common sense actaully happen exactly the way plot needs them to."
"Funny and entertaining with great visual effects, ""Spider-Man, far from Home"" is the kind of movie you'll watch only to pass the time if you pass over the idea that the movie stands on the shoulders of a juggernaut movie like ""Endgame"" and an iconic character like Tony Stark."
it sure is one of the movies ever. i felt a feeling while watching this. the writing was in the script and the plot was a story.
"Apr√®s un √©v√®nement comme ""End Game"" J'ai l'impression que le ballon ""action mature"" c'est un peu d√©gonfl√©."
"Tom Holland reste parfait en Spiderman. Son costume ""made in"" Tony Stark est formidable."
"Mais cet entourage scolaire, ce voyage √† Venise tellement clich√© passe mal."
"Des profs immatures, trop d'ados et leurs vannes √† deux balles."
"Myst√©rio et ses pouvoirs d'illusions....alors que des quartiers de Venise s'√©croulent, c'est difficile √† avaler aussi."
"Bref un film d'ados, avec trop d'ados, qui s'adresse √† un public cibl√© tr√®s jeune."
Dommage.
Les effets sp√©ciaux quant √† eux restent impeccables.
The people who rated this movie are on crack.  The storyline is stupid and doesn't make sense.  Holograms don't work like this.  The comedy was lacking.  Nothing compared to the original
One of the most dynamic Spider-Man telling's in cinema. Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) absolutely kills it.
La verdad esperaba m√°s de esta pel√≠cula
"Out o the ""Home Spider Man trilogy, this one is my favorite. I've watched it so many times. The casting is good, the plot is good, the excecution is good. I 100% recommend this movie!"
"Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't as good as the first film, but it's still a fun and worthy sequel to the first film!"
To put it simply: A fun and great Spider-Man film. I love Mysterio.
The plot line was literally weak but screenplay pulled off. The characterisation of Mysterio was good. Post credit scene was incredible cliff hanger.
"""Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic and emotional journey that brings together characters and themes from across the Spider-Man universe. Tom Holland gives an incredible performance as Peter Parker, showcasing the character's growth and struggles as he faces his toughest challenges yet."
""
"The film's plot is intricately woven, taking the audience on a rollercoaster ride of action, humor, and heartbreak. The returning cast members from previous Spider-Man films are a joy to watch, and the new additions to the cast bring fresh energy and dynamics to the story."
""
"One of the most impressive aspects of the film is how it balances the high-stakes action sequences with the emotional depth and character development. The relationships between the characters are the heart of the film, and the actors all bring their A-game, creating a believable and relatable world despite the fantastical elements."
""
"Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fantastic addition to the Spider-Man franchise and a must-see for fans of the character and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a film that leaves you on the edge of your seat, emotionally invested in the characters, and eager for more."""
""
Rating: 5/5 stars.
"This movie is so fun to watch. This is one of the best Spider-Man Movie that I have watched. The chemistry of Tom Holland, and Zendaya was absolute perfect. It is mixed with Action, Teen Love, Amazing Visuals and more."
Overall a decent Spider-Man movie. I really liked Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio and find him to be the biggest highlight of the film. Unfortunately this movie is very forgettable since No Way Home outshines it in every aspect.
Tom's the best Spider-Man
"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is a thrilling and action-packed superhero movie that delivers on all fronts. Under the helm of Jon Watts and featuring Tom Holland as the arachnid-inspired protagonist, this cinematic masterpiece resumes immediately from where ""Avengers: Endgame"" concluded. Diving into the repercussions brought about by those pivotal moments in that aforementioned film."
""
"The plot follows Peter Parker as he embarks on a school trip to Europe, hoping to leave behind the pressures of being Spider-Man for a while. However, his plans are quickly interrupted by the arrival of a new villain, Mysterio (played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhaal), who threatens to destroy the world as we know it. Peter must team up with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his fellow superhero, MJ (Zendaya), to stop Mysterio and save the day."
""
"One of the strengths of ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is its excellent balance of action and humor. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and visually stunning, while the comedic moments provide a welcome breather from the intensity. The chemistry between the characters is also a highlight, with Holland and Zendaya's on-screen romance being particularly charming."
""
"The film's visual effects are also top-notch, creating a vibrant and dynamic world that truly brings the character of Spider-Man to life. From the fast-paced action sequences to the stunning set pieces, the movie is a visual feast that is sure to satisfy fans of the genre."
""
"Overall, ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is a highly entertaining and engaging movie that showcases the best of the superhero genre. With its strong performances, impressive visual effects, and thrilling action sequences, it is a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and superhero movies in general."
""
"Its the great movie , fun to watch on weekends."
RECOMMENDED!
Plot twist was presented nicely
Awesome movie! Love Tom Holland as Spider-Man! Always a fun watch! Mysterio was great!
"At√© que esse filme √© bem bacana, n√£o tinha nenhuma expectativa nele, mas o filme se mostrou ser bem interessante, recomendo a todos assistirem. Muito bacana como est√£o sendo feitos os filmes do Homem Aranha"
Muito bom tudo √© bom s√≥ n√£o √© muito ligado com coisas da marvel
"Spiderman: Far From Home"" is an exciting and action-packed addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland delivers a charming and relatable performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and the supporting cast, including Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal, also shines. The film is visually stunning, with impressive special effects that bring the superhero action to life. The story is engaging, with twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. While the film could have benefitted from a bit more character development and emotional depth, it still delivers a fun and entertaining experience for fans of the genre. Overall, ""Spiderman: Far From Home"" is a must-see for Marvel fans and action movie lovers alike."
Spider-Man: Far From Home is funny and entertaining film that delivers well thanks to its  impressive visuals and acting.

"Movie felt too ""set in the real world"" to find the technology used by the main antagonist believable. If it feels out of place, it removes you from the movie."
"Felt like a television sit-com. The acting is horrid. The story is non-existent. I felt like Marvel wanted a movie before ""No Way Home"" for a quick buck and they rushed it out."
It was a fun superhero movie but not a great Spider-Man movie. There was much fun to be had but they jumbled through a lot of plot points and silly side plots. Some cool and creative visuals and a really good villain later and you have an entertaining but not great Spider-Man movie.
"Pretty solid, amazing spider-man movie"
So far the best Spiderman movie for me.
"entretenida ,divertida y  escenas fabulosas pero un guion faltante ,un desarrollo de personaje repitente y falta de mas personajes carism√°ticos hacen de esta una pel√≠cula para pasar el rato y conocer una nueva historia sobre spiderman"
"Despu√©s de Avengers: Endgame, ahora inicia un nuevo cap√≠tulo en el universo de Marvel. Empezando primero con Peter Parker dispuesto a seguir adelante y con esperanza de continuar el legado de Tony Stark. Esta pel√≠cula ya nos muestra a un Peter que tiene que dar un paso m√°s adelante tras lo sucedido en la pel√≠cula anterior. Tom Holland no termina siendo un mal Peter Parker aqu√≠ a pesar de que tiene a√∫n mucho que aprender. Misterio en esta pel√≠cula es muy diferente a la versi√≥n de los comics, pero Jake Gyllenhaal fue una buena elecci√≥n para interpretar al personaje. Esta pel√≠cula ofrece una dosis de acci√≥n, comedia y secuencias fant√°sticas. Es una buena mejora para el Spider-Man del MCU. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 9/10."
Loved this film! Jake Gyllenhaal was awesome!
I have no nostalgia for non of the spider man movies but this movie is good but it still has its up and downs.
i like how peter and mj feelings develop here
"As a follow up to the biggest movie ever, this movie holds its own. Showing Peter struggling with the loss of his mentor and losing 5 years of time is done so well, and Mysterio is an amazing villain, taking away the comicality of his evil plan, but it is a comic book movie after all, so it is excusable."
"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is a thrilling and action-packed superhero film that continues the story of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and his journey as a hero. With solid performances, good direction and an exciting and emotionally charged story, it's a film that will entertain and excite fans of the Spider-Man franchise. It's a film that showcases the incredible special effects and technical mastery. It's a film that tells a classic story of identity and responsibility, with a sense of epic scope. It also introduces new elements and characters, making the story more compelling."
"A perfect standalone movie to follow-up to the events of End Game. Still not a fan of Tom Holland or the CGI spider-man, but Mysterio was an awesome villain. It ends in a shocking cliff hanger that gave me anxiety for years. Action and comedy on point. Did  I mention it gave me anxiety?"
"Pretty good, but definitely the weakest of the trilogy."

Edit: rewatched it recently. It got a little better.
Tom Holland stars as the iconic New York web-slinger in Jon Watts' second addition to the MCU. The film seems to answer many questions Marvel fans have about the MCU's future including what is Marvel going to do moving forward with the MCU? How is a post-Avengers world going to affect the MCU's future? And will Spiderman have a bigger role in the MCU moving into phase 4?
""
"The film follows Peter Parker as he navigates international waters and coming to terms with Tony Stark's unfortunate death. However, Peter's school trip soon becomes hijacked by Nick Fury as a new threat becomes increasingly imminent, putting Peter and his friends at risk. This new threat doesn't arrive solo though. It's accompanied by Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is soon revealed to be Peter's worst enemy rather than his new BFF. As the film comes to a close, Beck is apprehended and Peter finally gets the girl of his dreams, sealing the deal with a quick smooch atop of London's Tower Bridge. If you're a dedicated Marvel fan, make sure you stick around until after the credits because the post-credit scenes help to set up the MCU's future in a way that makes viewers question the scene's true intentions."
""
"Jon Watts makes brilliant use of incorporating the wider MCU into his films. Be it the background or foreground, nearly every shot features a link to the cinematic universe. The plot is something that isn't exactly well known for featuring in a superhero movie - I mean how often do you see Captain America or Iron Man on European holiday? But that's something that makes 'Spiderman: Far From Home' such a refreshing addition to the MCU, as it's something that Marvel's never done. Like any Marvel movie, the action starts from the get-go, not even thirty minutes into the film and viewers are hit with Parker's first fight, full to brim with stunts and tricks. Michael Giacchino's score is the perfect thing to get viewers into the world-travelling mood and considering world travel is on hold, 'Spiderman: Far From Home' is possibly the closest thing you can get to a holiday right now. Something that Marvel does well with their films is delivering an equal mix of intensity and heartfelt emotion to viewers, and 'Spiderman: Far From Home' is the quintessential example of this."
""
"Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker has been captivating and consistent since his first introduction in the 2016 blockbuster 'Captain America: Civil War' - he presents Parker as the boyish, lovable, compassionate teen Stan Lee and Steve Ditko wanted him to be. Other characters returning alongside Holland include Zendaya as the curious and observant MJ, Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds - Peter's fun, ebullient BFF. As well as Peter's friends, viewers will also meet Peter's new classmates and Nick Fury's new friends. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the suave, power-hungry villain Mysterio who, by the end of 2h 9m runtime, has turned from friend and ally to his biggest enemy. Even after Mysterio's story comes to a close he still manages to put Peter in danger - revealing his true identity in front of millions of New Yorkers in TheDailyBugle.net's daily broadcast, which also features a cameo from J.K. Simmons himself. Although Marvel movies aren't known for being didactic, Holland's portrayal of Parker radiates resilience and responsibility which can't help but be passed on to younger viewers. Something that viewers should take away from 'Spiderman: Far From Home' is that a post-avenger MCU is still filled with all sorts of exciting avenues to be taken."
""
"In conclusion, 'Spiderman: Far From Home' is Jon Watts' second addition to the 28 picture strong universe, filled to the brim with explosive stunts, complex plots and Tom Holland's boyish charm. Far From Home also ramps viewers up for Holland's third outing as the popular web-slinger due to arrive December next year. So, if you're a Marvel fan, 'Spiderman: Far From Home' will certainly be on your watchlist. Even if you're not, Far From Home is a great watch for all the family - viewers of all ages will enjoy this explosive adventure!"
crititcs and audience are so dumb for giving this movie a fresh rating
Es buena dentro de todo
Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal are pretty good in this. Too bad the movie around them is so lackluster.
BORING MOVIE HAS A LOT OF JOKE IS A ROTTEN SCRIPT
A very action packed movie just how I hoped.
"When watching far from home in theaters 3 and a half years ago, I was loving it. I thought it was great. Now though.. i still like it a lot. Its not that consequential and there isn't that much weight, but its just so fun. Everyone does a great job, especially Samuel L Jackson and Jake Gyllenhall, as well as Tom Holland. There is not a lot to say really. Its a good, fun and rewatchable movie. Great action, great comedy, but lackluster emotion."
Had to edit this review because I accidentally posted my review for No Way Home on this movie. This movie is just average as far as MCU movies go. The best parts of the movie are not even about Spiderman with the post credits scene rightfully so being the most memorable thing about the entire movie.

Not terrible. Not memorable. Just average MCU filler.

My Number one favorite movie in MCU's Phase 3 and a perfect film to end the Infinity saga
"No es la mejor pelicula de spider man, pero la historia puede llegar a ser entretenida por si quieres pasar un buen rato, pero para mi no es la gran cosa y es bastante olvidable hoy en dia."
I thought it was a good follow-up sequel that was a slow-build in the beginning and maybe a little too cutesy but finished well while leaving us wanting more in the next sequel.
Despite the whole vacation aspect being a little corny. This is a lot of fun with a great villain.
"With one of the less explored facets of Peter Parker in the cinema, it is a good movie"
"Really enjoyed it, it was fun and easy to watch, Peter is a bit of a twat at times but that's him isn't it."
Very underrated but there's a lot I would've done differently.
"not always focused on whats important, but a very cool villian and story."
"On the same level as its predecessor and a worthy follow-up to Endgame, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a wonderfully fun, romantic, caring and action-packed movie that has heart and emotion to it while delivering a stellar cast who all pretty much give amazing performances, the only negative is the main antagonist Mysterio."
Mystero is a Villan because his tech was named barf.
Best of Movies/TV Series Collection
This movie is good despite being not that big because the villain in this movie is a guy . That is what makes Mysterio special he deceives Spider
- Man Instead of just fighting him

The best part was the passing-time school bus trip stuff
"Exceptional casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as the enigmatic Mysterio. Tom Holland delivers a another solidperformance as Peter Parker, masterfully portraying the character's inner turmoil as he navigates the challenges of leading a double life. The film's action sequences are executed with precision and flair, while the use of visual effects is particularly noteworthy."
"The most beautiful Spider-Man live action movie. The European settings, the Elementals and the psychedelic scenes are an amazing threat for the eyes. Tom Holland and its cast of classmates are as charming as the first movie and Jake Gyllenhaal has a contagious fun playing Mysterio. The movie while very entertaining falls under the first one because of loosing the highschool charm of Homecoming for bigger action and MCU development. This movie references past MCU events and introduces new elements to other MCU storylines (some doesn't even have any impact on this movie). Things get a little out of control with how technologic it gets, Spider-Man has now access to Iron Man's artillery and it sometimes feel a little too much. There is also this very weird scene where a woman orders Peter Parker to undress in front of her, if it somewhat helps the plot to move on, it does feel out of place. The movie has still a way better final confrontation than the first one (which was uninteresting) and the first post-credit scene is a real game changer, the second one feels out of place and tacky though."
Mediocre movie. Second worst Spiderman movie every made. Horrible villian.
"While it's an important part of the MCU, it's writing, timing, acting, and directing are nothing to be smiled upon."
Another good Spider Man movie that sees Peter Parker trying his all to save the day!! The character of Mysterio was definitely an interesting addition.
"enjoyable, interesting opponent."

Mysterio was a really great villain even though I already knew he was a bad guy from the comic while I was watching this I kept thinking maybe he isn't? It's always great when a non superpowered character can take on someone as cool as spiderman and beat him with pure intellect.

Really appreciate what they've done with this movie. 5 stars
The movie plot was good but the villain want just avenge iron man for stealing peters EDITH
took me so long to find this movie. not on disney + or netflix. `you have to watch this before no way home. loved it.
"I think this movie should be a good choice to follow Avengers 4, because most audiences still can't get out of Iron Man's death at that time, which made this movie even more moving when it came out, and this movie also made Spider-Man has his true path, not following in the footsteps of his predecessors. Although the previous episode has reached this point, this episode truly believes in himself, and it also represents that Tom Spider-Man is not the second generation of Iron Man. It just inherits the point that Iron Man itself is a bit similar to Spider-Man"
The most underrated film out of the trilogy so far Mysterio is great so is the plot
My rating for the film is a 8.6/10
The best part in this movie is when the credits finally role.  The whole story is trite and boring. Easily the worst out of the 7 Spider-man movies.
I think that this is the worst movie of Spider-Man in live action and the reason of why I think that is because:
In this movie peter parker wants to forget that he is Spider-Man.
He does not want more responsibility.
AND SPIDER-MAN IS OVER-ALL..... RESPONSIBILITY.
"""Responsility"" is the word that describes Spider-Man; Responsibility on acting when someone needs it, but in this movie he just wants to forget all of that just because he wants a girlfriend"
Good movie üé¨. Very entertaining
It's fun and exciting to see the aftermath of the endgame event. This movie is so much fun to watch. There are so many likable characters in this movie. Mysterio's motivation is clear and the character balance with spiderman pretty well. The story is unpredictable and the CGI looks amazing
A fun teen comedy held up by fantastic performances by Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as the supporting cast.
""
Jake Gyllenhaal's mysterio is just so fun too.
"Horrible, what a joke, spiderman is not suppose to be a joke!"
"This movie gave me a very similar liking to Homecoming. The story was entertaining which had may of fun aspects and surprises to go along with it. My favorite thing about this movie has to be how this setup the next movie. Once again, Tom Holland does not disappoint."
"Spiderman far from home is an ambitious film that is lost due to a generic script and a bad development, for movie lovers it is a normal film but it still makes the MCU more complete"

"Far From Home does a good job following it's predesecor, Homecoming, continuing Peter parker's journey and his struggles balancing a normal teen life (and romance) as well as being a superhero. Jake Gyllenhall's Mysterio is a unique villain, and there is awesome choreography because of that. Although this movie's plotline is weaker than I'd like, Far From Home is a great installment in the MCU (plus, it introduces the multiverse, something that will take a large role in future projects)."
One of the most forgettable movies in the MCU.
"After a little bit boring first half, Marvel made few of the best fight sneces in the MCU"
I didn't recall a thing about this movie. I had to watch a recap just confirm that I'd seen it before watching No Way Home. I think that about sums it up.
"I hate this movie even worse because he behaves far too childish, villains are not opponents of peter but tony although he is dead, his costume is not spiderman but ironboy or ironspider -_______-"
"What a sequel, The mid credits were speechless."
The action and illusion scenes were mind-blowing and the story and the Cgi is brilliant. The  story around college trip and the mysterio with the multiverse stuff and illusions it was just Amazing. Its a Great movie!
"my friend hate it, but i do like it"
"Great time, good heart, and a pretty good story. Mysterio's plan had plot holes but other than that good movie."
Great first movie set post endgame Tom holland shines once again as Spider-Man
"Spider-Man: Far From Home delivers a great story while also giving us some top notch humor. Story, acting, and effects were all 10/10. I highly recommend this movie."
This movie is cool and you have to watch it.

This movie is better than No Way Home and a lot more interesting and entertaining.

"It is filled with tons of cool effects and visuals, especially the part where Spiderman has to use his tingle to fight the drones."

I do recommend this movie and recommend watching this movie before watching No Way Home.

"This movie is visually chaotic (for the character, the not viewer). I rate this movie 10/10 (Masterpiece)."
"This movie was fully produced by the heartless, soulless, and unhappy Disney film factory"
Loved it!!! Love Marvel!!!
"As far as MCU movies go, i found this middle of the road. The movie really wants Spiderman to be Ironman when I just really wanted to see his Euro-trip play out. While Mysterio isn't a terrible villain, the action in this film just wasn't that good. Elemental monster and random magic galore with little variety between set pieces. Of the three Tom Holland Spider-man movies, I found this to be the worst of the bunch."
An amazing movie but it never says true to the previous movie (Homecoming) and it totally forgets the character of Peter Parker/Spider-man.
Cool suit. Mid movie. I HATE ITALY
This movie gets alot of hate but I love it and I can rewatch it many times
"Been watching my way through the recent MCU highpoints: Fun romp. Like a lot of the recent Spidey outings, ranges into silly more frequently than necessary, but entertaining. I like JakeG a lot, in other roles, but for some reason Mysterio never really felt like a good fit. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
""
"Heh, I do find that the younger they make SM, and the older I get, the less entertaining I find the ""high school hijinx"" aspect of the revision."
Love a good SM movie
"1st one was better, this one was sloppy, bit cliche, but it was entertaining,"
"Another crowd-pleaser, but this Spider-Man did not do it for me again. Even when Iron Man is dead he isn't his own independent hero."
Lot of fun. Definitely worth a watch.
Another fantastic MCU movie. This movie have a part of fun and (short) love part. Actors are fantastic. I have not words for this movie 5 stars for this movie. Good job Marvel!!!
The best part was the passing-time school bus trip stuff
"This movie is a great sequel. I love the concept of this villain, one of the coolest yet, but the character himself is... meh. Also, some of the things that happened made no sense, and you felt like ""How did they not see him do that?"". It is still a very good movie, the fights are excellent, and the pacing felt just a little weird at places but it was still good, and Peter got some development. Once again Holland does an excellent job."
7.5/10
muito bom recomendo a
"Now, this is very heavily opinionated as I think that the movie in itself is a fine one. Its story, dialogue and especially villain all hold up as their own thing, and would usually be getting something like a 3.5 or 4 star. However, as a huge fan of Spider-Man, I despise what this movie did to the character. Even when this movie sought out to make Spider-Man his own character and not just Iron-Man 2, right after the scene in the plane with Happy where they establish this, Happy goes on to blair out Tony's playlist and have Peter Parker create a suit from Stark Tech machines with holograms accompanying it. The cinematography is bland and the sudden interest Peter has for MJ offscreen is a jarring development as it is never explained how Peter grew this sudden interest, why he's interested or is it even hinted in any previous appearance of Spider-Man. Mysterio is one of the few thing I do like about this movie, and even then I have a major complaint with him. Mysterio is one of my favourite Spider-Man villains, and I think making him a disgraced Stark Industries worker in this universe makes sense. However, it also adds to the whole idea of Spider-Man being the next iron man, as we are given 2 villains in a row who's motivation it is to get back at Tony Stark. The ending of the movie gave me a huge slap in the face where both Peter and May don't care that Uncle Ben's suitcase, one of their last remaining remnants of him, was blown up in England, and brushing it off for comic relief, but also a boringly shot final swing that doesn't feel earned or grand."
unfortunately the plot is kinda bad but it is enjoyable.
"This film does a great job capturing teenage naivete while also showing the vulnerability that accompanies loss. There's just enough comedy to keep it light and real, but it's honestly pretty heavy."
"Ages 13 and older!!!!!!! The first Spider-Man movie with Samuel Leroy Jackson as Nick Fury. Rated PG-13 for language, some suggestive comments, and sequences of science fiction action/ violence!!!!!!!!!"
"I think this is a lot of fun, with the same level of entertaining and good storytelling as Homecoming, but something about it doesn't hold up as well as the first."
Cool suit and cool villain. Kinda corny tho
"I enjoy Jake Gyllenhall in this film, but Far From Home is not as good as Homecoming. However, it's an enjoyable movie that is worth a watch and a re-watch."
""
Rating - Great
Mysterio is one of the most unique villains unfortunately he has conflict with iron man not spiderman.
"MCU delieved yet again. ""Far From Home"" is a thrilling movie with an amazing plot, what else can you ask with the MCU Spider-man movie series?"
"Tom Holland's Spiderman vs Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio?  Yes, please.  Once again, an awesome follow up to Homecoming."
"The visual effects are great, the 2nd Best MCU Spider-Man Film"
"Filme divertido , mas o primeiro filme do Homem aranha ap√≥s a morte do Homem de ferro .. o Peter √© sem gra√ßa ... As cenas de a√ß√µes s√£o legais , mas apesar de tudo √© apenas um filme divertidinho"
"Entertaining enough and a definite improvement on Tom Holland's first Spider Man film, but the writing was still far worse than it should have been. The plot was again too linked to the Avengers/Iron Man films and pathetically unbelievable thanks to the pretend superhero, massive holograms, and glasses that give you access to thousands of military drones. There was far too much technology and not enough superpowers, with lots of irrelevant moments, such as the Nick Fury plot points. However, the travelling aspect was fun and allowed for lots of scene variety. The villain was unpredictable to start with, but his motivation was generic, his actions became predictable apart from the twist ending, and almost everything about him lacked believability, like the fact that he had a team. Nick Fury didn't need to be there and got painted in a bad light. However, Spider Man and his friends were better than the first film, although he still wasn't very competent. The pacing was acceptable, the acting was well done, the cinematography and visual effects were decent, and the soundtrack was fine."
"A really funny, memorable and action packed movie all tied together by (Spoiler!) a shocking plot twist"
"Se fosse um primeiro filme teria sido bom, afinal, a jornada do Homem-Aranha nesse filme √© √≥tima exceto por um fato... Ele pega todo desenvolvimento de Homecoming (2017) e descarta, √© uma desperd√≠cio e ainda gasta tempo focando DEMAIS no Homem de Ferro."
Nota: 39% ‚òòÔ∏è
"""Whoa! This is heavy..."""
"I really enjoyed watching this wallcrawler tale. I like Zendaya's character. Letting Parker know he's #1 was classic. I kept thinking though there seemed to be a lot of child endangerment in this one. If anyone wants some ideas for spoofing, I think giving Parker a DeLorean and him calling Tony Stark ""Doc"" would be some good chuckle material..."
"...or 'Spider-man Has Tourettes'. Colourful effects and another terrific central performance by Tom Holland can't disguise the overblown and nonsensical neediness of the screenplay, which darts around Europe in a vain attempt to paper over the cracks of an increasingly unfathomable plot. And the meta gags are overdone and unfunny. Time to get back to basics, guys."
Not a spider-man movie
V√£o no canal da lubonbon e do lhamado üòçü•∞
Great movie!! Zendaya is magnificent as the best MJ ever
"This movie has perhaps the best villain in the MCU, which isn't saying much because 90% of them are either terrible or forgettable."
I would say this is a 10/10 movie but the only problem is the villain. I just feel that they wasted his potential. ‚ÄòNough said!
You may find some parts confusing. Far From Home still has unpredictable moments and wonderful CGI that still never fails to amaze audience.
Spider-Man Far From Home doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. Some parts of the story and action do make up for it.
"couldve been lot better, still fun and a complete other view of spiderman"
"SIMPLIMENTE FEZ EU PERDER O MEU DINHEIRO. QUE FILME MERDA, PUTa que pariu esperava mais da marvel"
I love Led Zeppelin!
Not the best spider man movie
"Tom Holland's sophomore appearance as Spider-Man certainly does not disappoint. Holland not only shows he can play an entertaining Spider-Man, but he also shows he understands the importance of playing a good Peter Parker as well. In this film, we see Peter try and take the roll left to him by Tony Stark (The MCU's Ben Parker to him). We see Peter continually doubt his abilities both as a superhero and a teenage boy. The amount of growth by Peter in this movie continues to show that Spider-Man is the most relatable superhero we've seen. What really shines in this movie is Peter and MJ's relationship progression. Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry no doubt due to their real-life relationship. Both play characters that made me say ""Yep, this is how awkward teenagers act"" throughout the movie. Gyllenhall's Mysterio is fun, but I would have loved to have seen him play a hero because I feel he exudes the charisma of a superhero. The mid-credit scene is a real treat for those OG Spider-Man fans with the return of J.J. Jameson."
""
"The low points of this movie are the CGI and casting of May Parker. The CGI can be great in some areas and very poor in others. Also, I kind of understand why Marvel decided to cast someone young to play May, but it's still weird. May has always been this fragile woman who has guided Peter's desire to protect the weak. But in this version, she is hooking up with Happy, so it feels a bit out of character compared to previous versions of May. I do like that Peter's identity was revealed to her after the first movie. Something about that just makes it feel like he has a partner to help him. Overall, fantastic movie. I will definitely watch this one again."
"The scene where mysterio hypnotizes spider-man is great and well done. But it's the only thing about the movie I can find that's good about it in my opinion. Jake gyllenhaal is a great actor, but the script is so bad there's no much he can do. Sad they screwed up and ruined the reputation of one of marvels coolest villains. I wished they would've save him for later in a more serious role in a film. Sad we won't get to see it now"
"It is a good work, but controversial and confusing. A film after the events of EndGame and Homecoming in Peter's life. All the maturing and character development goes down the drain in this movie. A Peter who almost kills his friends out of jealousy (?), Peter naive and immature. One of the good points of the film is its CGI."
i love this movie more then homecoming because that movie i did like it but i don't  call it a marvel movie.this movie explores movie about his life we are learning more about his life the action is amazing using amazing CGI monsters i love that.i love beck he is great probably one of my favorite movie marvel villains he is great twist villain i hate twist villains but this one is great.the ending is great final battle i love that him fighting drones i love that its good to see mj and peter come to toeghter nedd is fun the bus scene is fun.i really loved the story its so amazing the elisions are so good and its about what happened to peter becks tricks on theses people are amazing i just love this movie it has problem nick fury adds nothing and that's my only problem.its a 9/10 its very epic
A good action adventure movie.
"This film is ok. Jake Gylenhall does a pretty good job as Quentin Beck (even though some of the writing on his character is hilariously bad). Holland steps up as Spider-Man, which is very much appreciated. And we get more Zendaya, which is always a good thing. But the script is so cheesy at time, making the story often feel like it's targeted exclusively at ten year olds, but Mysterio's plan makes no sense and the character's potential isn't really realised to the best extent. Weakest MCU Spider-Man film to date."
Its bad but 5 star cause tom holland best spiderman ong
"This is a very underrated movie in my opinion. It's beautifuly written and gives us some amazing action scenes. It is one of my go to movies to rewatch when I'm bored, and in fact, I'll probably rewatch it today. Fun buddy comedy with emotional consequences. Must watch!"
"Most of the people thinking this movie is bad including me, say starting too fast and it doesn't give enough importance to the fact that 50% of the people disappearing came back after 5 years. I think the first half of the movie is bored and for me the best part of the movie is Peter using the spider sense as a pro at the end."
Tom holland yet again plays spider-man incredibly.
Too late that I began watch Homecoming that I finally watched this film last night with my brother (another MCU fan). The illusions that technology can create in that movie was no joke! This budget was huge for a reason. 100/100 for me!
"I loved this movie. People give it lots of hate, but I really enjoyed it. Jake Gyllenhaal was a good choice for Mysterio, and it was cool to see Samuel L. Jackson team up with Spider-Man. This movie is incredible."
Amazing action throughout the movie. So many plot twists and an amazing ending. The chemistry of Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland is super great.
Maybe focus on getting a better plot instead of just shitty fake romance between tom and zendaya.
An underwhelming take on Spiderman who does not face real world problems
"good movie, not as good as homecoming tho"
This movie was good on the CG visual effects and more. The only thing is that this movie didn‚Äôt really changed much. It felt like they used the same formula as the 1st movie (Homecoming)
"D ~ In my opinion, the worst Spider-Man movie. Even worse than The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Over-reliance on Stark technology, jokes that aren't funny, no acknowledgement of Uncle Ben (an integral character in Peter Parker's life) other than a suit case that gets destroyed, not set in New York, Aunt May not caring about Peter's safety and using him for promotional reasons, and annoying side characters (especially the teachers). The best part was Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio and the post-credits scene. Overall, it didn't really feel like a Spider-Man movie."
"Una secuela que parece reebot, pero claro, innecesario de indefendible, seguro en 2019 siendo de disney esta basura, traj√≥ bastante cr√≠tico comprado, porque ni se dan cuenta que es una basura esto"
This movie has the second best cgi after tasm 2 but its enjoyable and entertaining but its story about some tony stark glasses is annoying but still good
The plot is so simple. I think Tony Star had so many problems to take care of. The CGI is so bad.
This was a really good movie
After End Game we have...
This?
I love Spider-Man but Spider-Man Far From Home throws all the development that Peter got in all the other movies and they involve Tony Stark again in a Spider-Man movie also throwing all the development of Mysterio on film.
But the good thing about the hundred is the CGI and the performances
n e um filme do homem aranha e sim do homem de ferro
It's a good movie and definitely is fun to watch but as a spiderman movie it sometimes dosent do well but if you watch it as a movie than it will be good and the best thing is that you can watch it far from home
Fake news rules the world; that's basically the implicit message... Good cast and screenplay! This young version of Spider-Man is the best!
"Far From Home consisted of many unique twists, turns, and trickery while also being an exciting set-up to No Way Home."
"Great movie, I must say, amazing comedy, [insert generic review], but it did lack a bit of sense when it came to the plot. Also, it seemed like the fact that our man Spidey was traveling all over Europe was just an increative way of setting up a variety of settings for dramatization, really. Overall, though, about a 18/21."
"Predictable and weak from the start, with a slightly stronger finish, this is a poor entry to the Marvel Universal, and nowhere near the comic prowess of Thor Ragnarok that it was trying for. Ultimately missable."
"This movie was a great and built on Toms Spider-Man a lot more making him feel more like Spider-Man then Tony. Yes there are a lot of call backs to Tony but this takes place right after endgame so it was to be expected, the plot was great and unpredictable and Jake did a wonderful job as mysterio."
A brilliant superhero movie - the best version of Spider-Man yet and the whole movie has a really good feel to it. Well done Marvel/Sony - great job.
Outstanding movie.  A definite must see.
Hate ends where it ends in memory loss of some sort. Poor writing clich√© that leaves a bitter taste. Otherwise good.
Great movie that i enjoyed alot! Must see!
Pretty good vibe just like the first one but pretty bland story and not a great spiderman actor lol
(VERY CLOSE TOO SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING)
""
"In Spider-man Far from home, there are a lot more funny scenes and great laughs, along with even more action packed scenes. It's just as good as Spider-man homecoming. The ending took me by complete shock, but in a great way. Tom Holland and Zendaya's performances are great and they are on top of their game as actors in this movie. Superhero fans will love this movie just as much as they've loved the Spider-Man Homecoming movie. With both of the two movies combined I definetely want too see Spider-Man: No Way Home. These are the kind of movies that are worth seeing in the movie theaters, and if Tom Holland and Zendaya ever do another Spider-Man movie, I will be seeing it in the movie theater. I'm very impressed by what they did. This time around the story was just as good and that's why I give it an amazing star rating. I love the glasses that Tom Holland gets as Peter Parker/Spider-man and everyone did a great job with the bus scene, when they drive too Prog,  that scene is funny and filled with action. I highly recommend this movie too any true Superhero Fan."

"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is an entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, delivering thrills and humour in equal measure. The Elementals provide visually stunning effects that add excitement to the action sequences, though the plot occasionally lacks the spark found in other Marvel films. Overall, it serves as a solid installment that keeps audiences engaged, but falls short of reaching the height of its predecessor."
Just a spiderman movie with zero consequences. It was mostly fun.
"Filme muito bom, vale a pena assistir"
"I don't really understand these people, this movie is clearly endgame hype, this movie is TASM level 2 so to speak, responsibilities don't exist, but as no way home has already released, I think this fil specific movie is very necessary for the whole plot of this spider, necessary but not significantly good. and as always Jake Gyllenhaal being the best at everything, I like this mystery but the drones, I don't know, bothered me a lot. I liked it."
"O primeiro filme depois do ""Ultimato"". Se passa algum tempo depois, Peter tem de lidar com a morte de Stark e com isso acaba por se diminuir e achar que n√£o √© capaz de suceder ao Stark e acaba fazendo uma asneira ao confiar em quem n√£o deve. Gostei de ver o Peter depois de um filme t√£o marcante como Endgame e gostei do facto de ele ter ido parar em v√°rios paises na Europa. At√© porque esse filme acabou ""a meio"" e s√≥ fomos ver a sua conclus√£o em dezembro de 2021."
"√â bom vermos o Peter lidar com coisas sem precisar sempre do Tony e com o ultimo filme do ""No Way Home"" √© interessante a gente ver ele ir para a faculdade e ficando a cada filme mais respons√°vel."
"In terms of marvel movies out there, this film is pretty run of the mill.  Mysterio and his motives are not super captivating,  the plot is fairly straightforward, the humor is there but isn't strong enough to carry the film.  We didn't get enough screen-time of Ned and JB Smoove (The King Baby),  but Happy was great and he shone well in the scenes he was featured in.  Honestly the best part of the film is the cliffhanger at the end, it really feels like this film is setting the stage for the sequel rather then standing firmly on its own merits.  If you are already committed to the marvel universe it's a good watch, but if you just wanted a one off superhero movie there are better movies out there, even just among other marvel films."
Nice seeing Jake Gyllenhaal have fun in a dumb superhero movie. Very forgettable movie though.
AMAZING!!!It is worth to see it!!!
a fresh and nice take on spider man would definitely recommend
shows how peter has to struggle with his two lives
very fun and entertaining
"This movie is one of my favorite Spiderman movies because of the thrilling action (especially the last bridge fight) , amazing performances by tom holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, good comedy that isn't overdone (like some marvel projects), and some of the most visually beautiful sequences in any marvel film."
"Enjoyable movie, but I can't see anything about Spider-Man here."
"This was a well done movie. They showed the aftermath of the Blip really well, and I think that Mysterio as a villain was decent. Pretty good movie overall. (Definitely make sure to watch the post-credits scene because it provides some key information.)"
Twists and turns-- Better than Homecoming pbly
"50% Romantic Comedy, 50% Action Short Synopsis: Plot very similar to Home Coming but in Europe, the writers did not think of a new story. The movie makes no sense since it doesn't explain why if there were hundreds of super heroes in End Game, now it turns out that there is only Spidey? isn't Stark more likely to inherit his glasses from Pepper Pots than Peter? Why can't Peter take a phone from his partner with just his spider powers? didn't Mystery have to give permission for Peter to wear the glasses? It is worth highlighting the visual effects, unlike the cartoon here they explain Mystery's powers very well, and the illusions he uses are amazing, I think Sony is managing to turn pathetic villains into imposing villains. The end of the movie is pure Spiderman-style action, meaning he pushes himself to the limit to save the world. At least I did find a moral to this movie and that is, if you make a big mistake in your life, you correct it based on courage and effort. I give this movie a 5/10 rating, if you expect a Sam Raimi-style work of art then don't watch it, but if you expect one more episode of spidey without logic similar to cartoons then go see it."
"Spider-Man: Far From Home, the awkward end of Phase 3 of the MCU, is a"
complete waste of time. It barely has any character development in it and
the story focuses too much on the school trip than actually showing Peter
"cope with the loss of Tony Stark, his father figure. The first two-thirds of"
"the movie was dull and did not contribute anything to the overall story, and"
"therefore completely skippable, and the final battle surprisingly bored me"
"even more than the other CGI final battles in the MCU. However, I will say"
"that Mysterio is a fantastic twist villain, however the movie does not give"
him enough screen time as a villain as the first two-thirds focused too
much on taking down the fake Elementals. This movie has extremely bad
humour and some very annoying characters; the tone is lighthearted while
not having any tension or stakes. The sole purpose of this movie is for
"Spider-Man's identity to be revealed, which only happens in a mid-credits"
scene.
""
If you like watching a romantic teenage comedy with Spider-Man shoved in
"it somewhere, then you will enjoy this movie. However, if you are expecting"
a movie focusing on Peter Parker and how he copes with losing his mentor
"and father figure, then this movie is total garbage."
Lots of action and lots of laughs
"A stunning, funny, eye opening and emotional fun ride thriller."
"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great follow-up to the successful first MCU Spider-Man solo movie. Just like before, it showcases one of Spider-Man's most popular villains. Jake Gyllenhaal acting was perfect, thanks to being a seasoned actor. Excellent special effects highlighted Mysterio's powers. The twist and turns were somewhat predictable but still highly entertaining. Tom Holland once again owned the beloved iconic character. This light, cheerful and fun atmosphere is best suited for Spider-Man movies, instead of the usual dark and gritty approach of some movies in the genre. The European setting was a marketing gimmick, but it worked. Zendaya is pretty and charming, but I don't really see her as Mary Jane. But that's just me. Jason Batalon is still funny as always, providing the humor. Great direction, pacing, special effects and script. Solid, fun and entertaining! Looking forward to more interesting villains in the next sequels."
"Spider Man: Far from Home was a good step in the development of the character inside the MCU, here he struggles to maintain a normal life as a highschooler while trying to fulfill his duties as a superhero, it's a well rounded movie with not much to complain about."
"Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-man. Charming, funny and dorky he really sums up the character. Fantastic film, great cast"
"An excellent movie showing two of Spiderman's foes the Shocker and the Vulture, everybody does a good job, even the Vulture!!!!"
A great continuation to Peter Parker in the MCU.
movie was an amazing way to continue the mcu with out Iron Man
CGI Spider-Man 1 was better than this movie
"In this movie, we see Peter struggling on his own for the first time since the events of Endgame. Peter inherits the edith glasses but feels as though he can't accept them. In a journey of self acceptance and Peter growing into his own skin, Holland, Zendaya and Batalon all excel."
"Tom Holland is once again impressive as Spider-Man but I felt this one was slightly weaker film than the previous one. The plot twist was rather predictable, I thought.  Still good fluff, though. I was entertained enough but I hope the third film is much better."
""
"Watched on Jan 13, 2022."
"Excelente pel√≠cula, me encanta como est√°n llevando al Spiderman de Tom Holland despu√©s de los eventos de End Game, unas vacaciones, momento de distraerse, ver a Peter Parker con la lucha interna de querer ser un chico normal que pasa el rato con sus amigos dejando a un lado sus deberes como el h√©roe que es."
The experience of watching this in the cinemas was one of the best of any marvel movies.
Another Best spider man movie . Another jewel for MCU.
BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER! I loved everything in this movie. I really want to see it again.
"Loved it, was pretty much ready to be disappointed but it did fan service without going all out and destroying it unlike some other recent films"
Nostalgia!!!...........................................................................................................................................................................
best popcorn movie of 2021
"I thought this film was EXTREMELY well done. The movie was incredibly fun to watch, the plotline was engaging and the fight scenes weren't as dragged out as I expected them to be, although maybe slightly long at times."
"He amado todo lo que hace Marvel Studios desde el d√≠a en que la conoc√≠ y est√° muy bien donde est√° y a donde va, el futuro brilla mejor de lo que podemos imaginar, me gusta a donde nos quieren llevar Kevin Feige y Disney+. Que l√°stima que no se animen a comprar todos los personajes que un d√≠a tuvieron que vender a sony pictures."
An explosion of nostalgia and nothing more. This is a children's movie. A boring children's movie.
"Even For non marvel watchers this was a great movie, really enjoyed it. Special effects and acting was excellent."
o maior fan service da historia do cinema
Best Spider-Man movie ever.
OH MY GOD THIS MOVIE IS F U C KING AMAZING I CAME SO HARD ONTO THE BACK OF THE SEAT IN FRONT OF ME WHEN THE SMA RAMI SPIDERMAN APPEARED THAT THE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME THREW THEIR DRINK ONTO MY GROIN SO MY BALLS WERE NICE AND FROSTY FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE 10/10 FILM GREATEST MOVIE EVER
EPIC EPIC EPIC!!! A movie only fans can only dream about before has come to reality!
Good by marvel and Spider-Man standards
I just don't understand the hype for this one especially when compared to the first two movies.  It was so boring and soft.  Super heroes crying and all in their feelings for half the movie.  I'm curious if it was a different director since it sucked so bad.
I really liked the bad guy and the growth of Spiderman in the movie.
A bit too much fan service! Less is more!
The action scenes are the best but the overall storyline of the movie seems quite lame and contradicts to many other stories of the MCU. But I loved the movie due to the presence of all the Spider-Men.
IT WAS SO DAMN AWESOME AND HILARIOUS AND I WEPT AND CHEERED AND LAUGHED AND IVE ALREADY SEEN IT 6 TIMES. Thank you Regal Unlimited! Andrew & Tobey deserve awards.
"Such a solid Spider-Man movie with great pacing, awesome characters and a fantastic story. So much love for this film, and that ending scene with peters spidey sense is unreal."
The Worst Spidey Sequel ever!!!. 1/10
Prob the best Spider-Man movie so far.. good to see all the others from previous movies written into the storyline.
"Even though (next to the Spider-Man movies) I haven't seen any Marvel movie, I like the Spider-Man ones. Maybe because, as a kid, I had some obsession with it, and everyone had to call me Spider-Man. I am impressed by the acting and visual effects in the movies."
"It's great: great acting, great story"
Absolute Must See!!
Absolute must see from any marvel fan this movie had me absolutely jumping for joy and kept my applause and attention through the entire run time. DEFINITELY a must see
The movie is epic. Full of nostalgia and emotions.
The best Spider-Man movie period!
Fan service's its awesome!
This is the most fun and rewatchable among the Spider Man films until No Way Home
This is what I expect. It doesn't aim to be something great but it aims to be lovable and memorable and I thank them for giving this memorabilia ‚ù§Ô∏è
This movie really shocked me at how amazing it was. Jake plays an amazing Mysterio and the whole illusion scene was the most epic thing I've seen in any spidey film.
"Great fx and cgi, terrible story and will rot your mind"
Full of fan service‚Ä¶I super enjoy it! But‚Ä¶without the fan service‚Ä¶just a regular super hero movie.
I had a bad time with this movie. It was a total mess. I couldn't make sense of anything that happened and found it impossible to care about any of it.
"One of the best movies of the year, you could watch it again if you want, it's amazing."
"it was predictable, i had it figured out from the first 5 minutes, they ALMOST had me thinking i was wrong, but nope, had it from the beginning."
"On a rewatch, this is the weakest fillm of the trilogy. Yes, Holland makes a great job here, there¬¥s a lot more of Peter Parker than Spiderman in this movie and he nails it. Gyllenhaal also elevates a not so well- written Mysterio higher than it should be, however, most of the supporting cast is treated like a joke, there¬¥s not development for Ned and the others, MJ only kicks off after the bridge conversation, before that she's just awkardly unfunny like in the previous film, and the main plot with Edith, Nick Fury and the ""Elementals"" is a bit lousy and uninteresting. The two battles between Mysterio and Spiderman are really cool tho."
"The culmination of the Sony-Marvel joint Spider-Man venture slings all the right webs, hitting the mark at every point. A terrific performance from Holland and Zendaya makes a moving, yet humour filled romp in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Actors reprising past roles in new ways make this film even more satisfying. A must see for fans of any version of the Web Slinger."
"Not the best Spider-Man movie by far, but I can appreciate what it was trying to do. The best thing about this movie is that it hinted at the existence of the multiverse. It gets a number of things from the comics wrong, which is a bummer, since this entire series is supposed to be taking place in the comic books' universe. They could have done better. The special effects were good though."
"Honestly after the first movie, I had no interest to see this. I watched so I can watch the third one and it's...fine... I do not understand the hype for this, let alone for thefirst. The plot twists were so obvious, and there were a number of inconsistencies in the story. I don't at all get the relationship of the two friends (I guess it was for humour, but really wasn't, and really wasn't necessary), nor why the competition for the girl just suddenly disappeared (if he was honestly interested, he would have let go so easily)."
"To be fair, I enjoyed it more than the first...but that's really not saying much."
"Watchable, but overall average, and definitely overhyped"
So outside of the obvious this another movie where everyone else is more interesting than Peter Parker. The best parts of the movie are the villain other than that not really much going on.
"Solid super hero movie, but not a lot of new things to carry it over. Had a good laugh, tho."
"I'd say that it was great, but it just didn't feel as though I could follow the plot nearly as easily as any other spider-man movies"
"Fresh for its take on a post-Endgame MCU future, Far From Home feels more and more distant as a film two years and a pandemic later. It also suffers from the same Homecoming issue of obsession with Tony Stark, the least interesting part of the MCU."
Super fun exploring all the aspects of being a teenager including hormonal changes haha great movie although the first one was slightly better
Liked it. Reframed from the current Marvel identity politics that has ruined their movies
It's a absolutely fantastic on all levels. Truly wonderful.
"Unique even for Marvel. A reunion of everything Spider-Man,! My top Marvel film after Guardians of the Universe"
"This is the Marvel universe at its best!  The multiverse we always hoped to see, with all these villains and Spider-Man on the same screen.  The banter between them was perfect, along with them being able to share their own shortcomings and how they dealt with it.  I don't know how they can expect to match DS2:MVOM to this.  The fan service paid was exactly what we needed after not having any big Marvel Movies.  Tying all of the series into this and then bringing  in Matt Murdock, and even the Venom-verse‚Ä¶ I can only hope Marvel gives the fans what they want and not what they think we need‚Ä¶ no more ""woke"" crap‚Ä¶ give us the source!"
"Not the best Spider-Man movie by a long shot, but this movie had everything I wanted and more. It also really made me appreciate the Andrew Garfield movies a lot more. This film got more right than the last two movies before it. The action was great, each character's arc felt justified, apart from some villains, and it wasn't overly reliant on references."

Worth a re-watch.

"Ironboy jr is in another MEH movie. Only good part is Nick fury but its also to WOKE as the MEDIA keeps putting these ""people"" in roles as in ones who curse to much. Also zendaya aint all that she prolly sound like a minecraft skeleton while walking"
"One of the worst MCU movies. Crappy acting, crappy story, crappy villain. And why tf does every MCU movie need to have humor? It doesn't work anymore."
A good follow up to the slower moving Spider-Man Homecoming. This film does a great job of addressing the events from Endgame and how Spider-Man deals with the pressure of being an Avenger while still being a teenager in high school.
Scratched a nostalgic itch.
"Unbelievable. It's everything I wanted and more. Stop reading the reviews and go see the movie. There are so many unexpected things that happen. The second post credit scene is a bit meh - it's more of a trailer but the movie itself was amazing. If you don't gasp and clap when you see this movie, you're not alive!"
The worst spider man movie of this new trilogy. I felt like I was watching doctor strange 1.5. Messing with time to fix a mistake for college was the worst story line ever.
INCR√çVEL E PERFEITO!
Another great Marvel/Sony Spiderman movie. It was great how they included the previous two franchises heroes and villains.
"√© um bom filme, com seus defeitos mas com certeza √© um filme incrivel !"
This was great. Stop canceling people because they are controversial. Bringing in Dr. Strange was great. Loved seeing all the old villains.
"Quando o filme √© bom nem tem muito oque falar meu amigo, o neg√≥cio t√° bom demais, se eu n√£o fosse um pobre fudido eu tinha ido ver de novo"
It's the best combination of Spiderman peculiarities. It's at the same time the end of era and the potential beginning of a new saga.
Absolutely satisfied.
Enjoyed the movie. Some of the actors seemed a little stiff and playing their parts but would watch it again.
It's everything we needed and more
"I loved the movie more than I thought I would! It was great to see the various ways characters from the MCU (be it characters from other movies or TV shows) were brought into the Multiverse. I definitely cried and cheered a lot, but so did almost everyone else at the showing I attended."
"Right on the nostalgia, Good and enjoyable film"
"Excellent as unexpected. Jake's a miscast, though. He tries his best, but still....... far from home!"
Really good sequel. I loved this. Absolutely awesome. Mysterio is one of my favorite villians and I absolutely loved who played him! I loved the visuals and art of the movie! 10/10!
This might be my favorite movie of all time. I fcking loved it! Don't tell anyone but I even cried a little bit.
"I loved it. It was the perfect ending to the trilogy. The crowd in my theater cheered so many times, it was an amazing experience."
Must-see for any Spider-Man fan.
What an awesome movie I'll be watching this multiple times!
Epic really good awesome story
"Cenas incr√≠veis, mas teve muito drama."
Stan Lee would not be proud.  Political messaging.  Movie quality is good for very young children.  Used to love spider man.  Now it's crap.
Awesome movie. Great ties to the past! And exciting new tie-ins. Best movie of the year! We need more Dr. Strange in the future for sure!
3 THAT'S A MAGIC NUMBER!!!! <3
War extrem unterhaltsam !!
√â bom esse filme bom vil√£o mas homem aranha n√£o era dos melhores
"Finally after a long time without any good movie I could enjoy one from the beginning to end. It's a great movie. Amazing acting, amazing plot and most important free of politics. I was able to see it with my boys without worrying about anything, just fun. Loved it!"
"No story, just fan service"
"I found this a very awesome sequel and allot of fun not as good as homecoming and kinda wears out the Tony Stark payback and kinda portraying Peter Parker as a Dumb kid, but has some amazing character development for MJ and Ned and was really good to see Jake Gyllenhaal in the MCU. Such a funny family movie and a fun time"
"Good fun but can seem a little long at times, the villain could of had a better introduction really and the reason why he was a villain than being upset that they didn't like his tech."
Amazing!! Best Marvel movie ever!
"It's fun, not the best Spidey ever, but keeps you entertained."
Best Spiderman of the series and top 3 best Marvel Movies.  Best movie of the year so far.
"Fantastic must see film,"
WOW! One of the bests movies of MCU!!!
Decent spider man movie. Not quite as good as Homecoming
Its....Like.....A.... Special Dream.......For Me Awesome....Movie....Best..... Spiderman...Movie...Ever....‚ù§Ô∏è LOVE MARVEL‚ù§Ô∏è
"It¬¥s a funny movie, but i think other movies are better than spiderman: far from home"
"Excelente villano y excelente actuaci√≥n gillahand , tom holland como spider man , tambi√©n  es muy bueno"
"Hands down the best Spider-Man movie ever made. it truly captured who Spider-Man is, and the cost of being a hero. I doubt I'll ever see another Spider-Man film that compares."
"Not getting all the love for this movie.  It seemed to be more slapstick than super hero movie.   When the movie was trying to build tension, it was throwing out silly one liners from the people that were facing potential death.  I guess it was a comedy??   But if I want a comedy, I don't need the over the top silliness and the bizarre story line.   Note to the audio guys, take it easy on the music score.  It was so over done with attempting to create moments of excitement that I felt I was trapped in a ride at Disney."
"Better than Homecoming, enjoyed this one quite a bit."
"The movie was excellent in every area. Action, Story, Characters, Effects. Marvel comes thru again and this is the best Spiderman movie. It's a must see"
"It's, to date, the best Marvel movie and, obviously the best Spider-Man movie. At all times things happen, there aren't five minutes without information"
"One of my favorite MCU movies! The music is amazing, I love the mysterio plot twist even if I already knew he was going to be evil. Its a huge improvement from homecoming! :D"
"This is the dumbass universe version where everyone is as dumb as a nut. Tony is MIT's MVP and funding contributor, 1 call from Pepper or anyone from Stark foundation would fix any enrollment BS. This movie is back to SONYs alley street fight mess, pointless and boring. Aunt May surely should got what she asked for. The only upside is fan service, AndrewG saved the show he's the only smarter person in this otherwise dumbass movie."
"this movie is better than homecoming. what I liked about this movie is that it was more serious, fun, funny, Misterio was a great villain, everyone's acting was great, I love MJ and peters relationship, they got the whole high school setting right, there were cool fights scenes, the suits where cool and I like the ending how his identity is revealed to everyone. what I didn't like is that I wish we saw more Misterio and I wish Misterio wasn't atached to iron man."
"It was nice and satisfying to watch some scenes, unfortunately it's all tied up in completely rotten handwriting."
"Such a brilliant movie, full of emotion and very interesting plot"
One of the best marvel movies.  Highly recommended
"This movie has everything you ever wanted, and everything you didn't know you needed."
Excellent addition to the Spiderman universe...opens up so many possibilities for other franchises!
"This movie was an absolutely stellar tribute to the prior spidermen films that not only kick-started the superhero movie boom we all know and love, but continued it throughout the years. While it is a great epilogue to the previous film series told through the Villians, it wasn't exactly the end of the ""Home"" trilogy I was hoping for. That being said, you need to see it for yourself to decide how you feel. After much internal debate, the movie over all was so phenomenal I decided that my quarrel with the way they closed the current trilogy was only worth half a star."
"A movie that takes anything that worked in its predecessor and makes it cheap with a bad story, weak humour and an inconsistent message"
A lot of fun! Time well spent. One or two weak plot points but it's Spiderman so it can easily be overlooked.
best spiderman movie yet! lots of fan serve though
Absolutely amazing!! I love the convergence of the universes!!!
Fun film with heart and sadness.  One of the better Marvel films.
Fun movie.  Not the best spiderman or mcu movie but will be in the top ones.  For my taste to  many secundary stories that do not contribute much to the main story just make the movie too long. Also the main problem that contribute to all spiderman movie plot/multiverse is just flat out dumb
An entertaining movie with too many conveniences
It's better than the other two! I enjoyed it. definitely would tell my friends to watch it
Absolutely amazing. Unpredictable and fresh and not the usual money train third movie of a trilogy!
"its a good movie, it has is fails but in general its very fanservice movie."
"A good written story, with loved and beloved characters. A great journey for you, your friends and your inner kid growth up with Spiderman."
"We saw the movie on Christmas. Time flew by. It was funny, it was sad. And the crossovers were made perfectly and were quite fitting to batch all movies together. The ending made you feel very bad for Peter, even it was the most heroic act, someone could do."
It was amazing I lived it
Great seeing the multiverse. Sad but good to see this Parker's hero moment
"A disappointing follow up from Homecoming. Not a bad movie by any means, but tries far too hard to be a fun follow up from the emotional ""Endgame"". When I watch this in the future, I won't be thinking ""Wow this is such a good palate cleanser after Endgame"" and so, the fun tone does little to make this version of Spidey appeal to me."
MJ is an improvement to her previous appearance but I still don't like that her and Peter grew to like each other offscreen and so the kiss at the end feels forced.
"I really like Ned and Betty, but overall this film doesn't handle the teen aspect nearly as well as ""Homecoming"""
"Gyllenhaal is pretty fun as Mysterio and has a menacing edge to him, but his motivations are pretty underwhelming. This is a world where existential threats to Earth are very real, and Mysterios big plan is to take out the people responsible for preventing said threats??? And what he is supposed to protect us from aliens with his drones?? The same problem I had with Zemo."
"I think Watts did well to improve on the action, the final battle is a one of the better MCU third acts fights. However Watts still lacks a clear directorial style and so a lot of scene feel visually boring."
Sony and Marvel gave what fan needed. They actually listen to their fans. Another Big Marvel Movie after Endgame. I love green goblin and his performance overall in movie.
Wow. Just wow is all i can say. üòç
The beginning was a bit slow but picked up and had a great ending.
Wishes fulfilled! Amazing story and development! Everything we've hoped for!
Loved it.  I'm definitely going to see it again.
"It's good only because it contai all our beloved character from the past spidey movie, otherwise it's just another poorly executed, thinly written spidey movie without any stylish fight scene and spectacular visual effects."
"This was a great movie theme's  of redemption dragged a little I some spots but all and all great I'd say I liked this one as much as the original, I gave it 4.5 would of given it 5 had they included a scene of that zendeah girl on the toilet, nothing gratuitous  or anything  like maybe  doc oc walks in and she dropping a duce  but other than that it was really good"
1000/10
""
Insane how they brought all this cast together.  I'm a huge Spider-Man fan. I've seen it 3x since it's came out haha. That should say enough.
One of my all time favorite MCU movies!! Great plot and great acting. Loved it!!!!! Must see on the big screen!!
great fun entertainment
"My personal Second Favorite Spider-Man Movie. People, Tom Holland and this cast are Real Teens in this movie, Nothing seems Fake! Its great, The humor is just right to leave you with Laughs and The Visuals are Outstanding! John watts Did great things with this movie and also Provided us with a great Villain. As always, Tom nailed Spider-Man and capturing the funny, goofy, Teenage Spider-Man! One of the best Ending battles in the MCU as well!!"
Loved it!!! All 3 Spider-Man together is PRICELESS!!!!!
"Just a great, fun and enjoyable film!"
It the typical Marvel slogfest...NOW WITH MORE CGI!
"The only other thing they used as leverage was nostalgia from past films. Hey remember when ""______""?! Yeah I remember, but this is just lazy writing."
This is one of my favorite Spider-Man films. I really feel like Peter comes into his own by the end. Loved the final showdown between Mysterio and Peter.
"Surprises and absolutely back to my childhood memories,,, oops ü§≠ whatever it's still excellente üòÇüëèüëçüêì"
As all the MCU properties just seem to blend together into some kind of grey indistinguishable blob it's nice to be reminded of the other Spider-Man movies where Peter had actual stakes and hardships and not just some rich father figure and perfect apartment
This movie is amazing!
"This film is the worst of the arachnid, where you can find flaws in the script and a problem in the evolution of the character, which carries from before his second individual film. Where in his previous film we saw a progress of the character, an understanding of the concept of responsibility, in this one we see a more immature Peter who prefers to leave his responsibility in the hands of third parties. We have a script devoid of meaning and essence of our beloved character, with visual effects in the highest Disney style but with depth in the character plot; a dose of romance that fails in every way and a badly planned and developed villain. The positive points of the film are in the post-credits scene and in the special effects, but the negative points abound, almost completely overshadowing what this film does well."
So far this is the best movie in 2021. It makes me excited and sad at the same times.
"Well Spiderman wasn't horrible but I felt like they tried to pack way way way to much into this movie, so many things I didn't like as well. Killing off a main charter isn't out of the ordinary for the MCU but this time it was just a. Ad move. Also bringing in Tobey and Garfield felt so forced that it about makes you cringe. Was ut cool to see all three on the screen together yes but it was so gimmicky that it made me wish they hadn't done it. There was so many other thing they could've done. And now I guess he isn't an avenger anymore or not even an honorary one. And if the spell is true to what Dr Strange says no one not even the avengers know who he is and does that mean they don't know he exists? I liked the dynamic between Strange and him but I guess we will never see that again! Is it watchable? Yes it is! But is it the best Sony or Disney had to offer? Absolutely not! It made me wish they hadn't done it! And that promise Ned makes towards the end about never being a bad guy, I guess now he will be the hob goblin at some point because now that promise means nothing.  We were promised a movie on the scale of end game and what I feel we got was 1/10 of the movie end game was. I will say this tho it is way better that the loads of crap disney has been giving us lately! Wanda Vision was bad, Loki was ok, Shang Chi and the 10 rings was the biggest smelliest pile of garbage tho they've ever made. The ending saw him all alone and it just makes you leave the theater feeling sorry for him. I felt like they continually think spider man has to be miserable and can't be happy. I really wish Disney had never bought Marvel, or So y didn't have The rights to spider man, maybe then it could have been more fluid!"
"Considering this movie picks up from Avengers: Endgame, it's no wonder Tony Stark's passing had to play a huge role in the story. However, it feels like it gets in the way of the movie's true potential overall, especially with Mysterio's introduction to the MCU. Nonetheless, not a terrible movie and still worth its while somewhat."
"It was rather boring, plenty of fun action for the younger generation, but nothing to write back home about!."
"The circular premise that spidey boy would mess up the multiverse for his friends‚Ä¶.resulting in the death of a lot of people and is auntie for gods sake,  for two hours of mayhem, and then spidey boy finally accepts the first choice with half the city destroyed. This is a reflection of the weak will of modern western society and how it is so easily. entertained by stupid choices of self gratification. Make bad choices, cause chaos, correct bad choices‚Ä¶repeat and rinse"
"It is fun, sure, and the Mysterio sequence is cool, but a lot of it just feels far too stupid even for a big superhero blockbuster. The stuff with the glasses, the Nightmonkey thing, the new suit made via stark technology despite him supposedly breaking out of Iron Man's shadow, Nick fury being off world, Aunt May sidelined to a romance with Happy, etc. It is clearly the worst of this trilogy, and it is pretty forgettable."
"Best Spider-Man movie yet!  Had everything, good comedy, heart, redemption, and true to what we would expect from our Hero.  Sony made a good move distancing themselves from the MCU going forward."
"Parts of the movie are great, other parts of movie are too stupid to comprehend. Whole sci-fi things fell apart after first 20mins but that is not the center point of the plot.. Whole Peter parker1,2,3 confusion seemed like a drag. Gosh i wish there was more of Dr. strange in the movie given he is probably only real actor in the movie. Too much stupidity and bad humor for 2:30 hours, i wish i had moved to another verse to avoid this catastrophe. Should have been named SpiderMan: No Way"
"Spider-Man: Far From Home takes numerous aspects from Homecoming and throws them right out the window. The story for this film is more subordinate than the Homecoming storyline as it takes away all the realism from the first film. Yes, the film is grander and takes place in more extensive settings. However, that extravagant nature feels unbelievable at times. Of course, this is a gigantic blockbuster superhero flick, but the two returning screenwriters do not even try to make it feel faithful to the first film. There are multiple scenes where Peter is in deathly situations, and there is a 100% chance of him dying. Yet, Peter gets directly back up again with a few bruises and a slight limp in his walk. How does getting hit by a European bullet train in motion not kill him? There are no repercussions to Peter's actions in his physical form. However, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers get Peter's storyline correct. With the combination of Tom Holland's flawless acting, Peter Parker is a stellar character with some steady growth throughout the film. Mysterio, also known as Quentin Beck, is close to being to the level of Peter, but his arc is slightly predictable. It is easy to spot where he is going in the future. Although, there were plenty of surprises that Beck had. The story overall, even though unrealistic, is stable. There are some slight tonal issues between the first and second half, but it comes together in the end. Plus, the comedy works a lot better here than in Homecoming. The jokes come off more naturally and do not feel forced at times. Although, Brad Davis is an awful character. I honestly feel bad for Remy Hii because Brad is not worthy of a role in this film. Brad is supposed to be Peter's bully, which makes no sense because Flash Thompson is right there. Just apply some of the ideas of Brad to Flash, and Tony Revolori would have made that role perfect. The teachers seem to be incredibly dumb, and it does not work. I know I just praised the comedy. Yet, I would not even call these teachers being comedic. They have no substance besides not knowing what they are doing most of the time. Martin Starr and J. B. Smoove help hide this flaw through their performances, but it still shows at times. Far From Home is a mixed bag when it comes to acting. Tom Holland does a phenomenal job in the lead role once again. It truly felt like he was saving the world even when the story was out of proportion. Holland also delivers an emotionally powerful scene that commences the third act perfectly. Jake Gyllenhaal was decent. Yet, unlike Holland, his performance did not come off effortlessly. Gyllenhaal seems to be trying too hard with his line delivery, and he does not quite grasp the character in some scenes. Samuel L. Jackson is great here. While this is not his best performance as Nick Fury, he sure does stand out in the cast. Zendaya is slightly off here, but it mainly seems like she was trying to make MJ fit her more expanded storyline. Jon Favreau is even better than his performance in Homecoming. Favreau truly understands Happy, and he made him such a fun, relatable character. Even with limited scenes, Marisa Tomei delivers another stellar performance. Lastly, there is Jacob Batalon. Batalon does not do a lot to make Ned stand out in the cast, but he has his moments. The technical elements of Spider-Man: Far From Home are slightly better than Homecoming. The visual effects are more pleasing but not perfect. There are still a few moments where the action sequences are not visually stunning. While I prefer his score from Homecoming, Michael Giacchino delivers another electrifying soundtrack. The cinematography is more refined this time around, with many shots looking more visually appealing. Spider-Man: Far From Home is far from perfect, but there are enough redeeming qualities to make it an enjoyable film. Tom Holland leads this film once again with the help of Jon Favreau and Samuel L. Jackson. The story sucks out all the realism, but the thrilling nature of the story does help keep the fast-paced story feel breezy and amusing. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com"
Great movie. Loved TM and AG. I was actually sad for TH when it was over.
BRILLIANT and AMAZING
"This Spider-Man takes you from the beginnings to the most recent bits of every Spider-Man movie you've ever seen. It combines humour, drama, action and an insane storyline that ends really where I secretly wanted  it to end. It was worth the IMAX experience that's for sure! Great movie for all ages."
The Miles Morales absence is what prevents this movie to reach perfection
"The worse Spider-Man movie to the date. Irresponsible Spider-Man, bad humour, and a bad copie of Homecoming. The only good thing about it is the villian (thank you Jake Gyllenhaal) and the visual effects. The rest is all trash."
Wow! That's all I got to say ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Absolutely mind-blowing. Spiderman has always been a fan favorite and bringing characters from the past just enhanced what was already great.
"There were seriousness, jokes and enough emotional scenes to make this film one of the best MCU movie to date. Never felt that the movie was long as it was broken into chapters and each of these chapters made up some really good story-telling."
I can't wait for the next Spiderman movie.
Funny and action packed. Loved the movie.
"Having now fought with the Avengers, it was important for Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow as Spider-Man. Learning to be the hero, actually think/strategize, make the important decisions, (attempt to) maintain a normal life. This is what we get here with this second installment."
"Film was okay positives were William Defoe ,   And the occasional cameo . It felt like it was trying too hard to be as exciting as Spiderverse but failed to be rebellious and young . Dr strange is almost becoming a comedic character so I hope the next film shows his darker side ."
The writers still seems to struggle with Spider-Man (boy) growing up and this film doesn't change that . I have heard of people being emotional watching this film but all I thought was it looked like a bad Apple TV movie - shot too straight and bland .
"A fun thrill that balances nostalgia and breaking new ground. Unexpectedly, I was able to get closure from three franchises beautifully. I've never enjoyed so many villains contained in one film. I loved that Peter Parker was able to have some surprise mentors."
Loved it! Yea.. had some flaws and things they could have done better.. but come on! It was solid. Gave almost all characters a good amount to shine.
"If you haven't cheered and had a bit teary eyes, you probably were in the wrong movie."
"one of, if not the best movie I have ever seen... the acting by all involved is simply next level and made the emotions stick! A must watch for all Marvel fans, and just about anyone else!"
This was hands down the best movie I have seen. It truly had me on the edge of my seat. I left the theater trying to wrap my head around how wonderful this movie was. This should have 100% on here.
I wish I could give this 105 stars! The best of the best!! Absolutely perfect!!
"Exceptional!! Loved, loved, loved it! 20 yrs of cinema, hats off to Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal for this masterpiece to spiderman fans! Go watch it!"
This movie teaches how to make fan services and retcon. üòä
"Very nostalgic, and it was a magnificent movie."
Great movie with fun surprise
Amazing!!! All we'd like see is there!!! It is the big and best Fan Service of the history!!!
What an amazing movie! Twists and turns that will have you laughing and crying. Nostalgic sequences around every corner. A true spiderman coming of age story. Well done!
"Spiderman Far from Home is the sequel to Homecoming, the second standalone spiderman movie starring Tom Holland and is incredibly fun and more intense than the original. While the first one was more lighthearted exploring Peter Parker as a young high school kid this one deals with him felling the burden of what it means to be Spiderman without the help of Tony Stark. Holland does a great job with this character and he is extremely lovable and charming with this character. His chemistry with Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury is great as there is tensions between them since Spiderman is reckless and Fury expects Spiderman to act like an avenger. Zendaya here as MJ becomes Peters love interest and is very satisfyingly to see how their love develops throughout the movie. The greatest performance goes to Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio who manages to bring his charisma and theatricality to this character the only way Jake can. Its an movie that challenges our hero and is way more fun, hillarious  and a little better than the first one."
"Great movie! So much action. It had a lot of characters, but it didn't feel overwhelmed by so many. Would watch again and again."
"It's a fun, little underwhelming sequel that looks great but lacks a little in the surprises until the end."
Best marvel movie of all time
Hands down one of the best Spiderman films. The storytelling was perfect.
"A great villain and some beautiful set pieces are the real treasures in the otherwise average Spidey flick. The film doesn't quite capture the heart of Holland's first outing, thanks in part to some really ridiculous slap-stick sequences which fail to hit their targets...literally. There is truly some great stuff here, just didn't quite tick all the boxes of Homecoming. 7.5/10"
"Just when I was starting to get tired of the Marvel formula, they come out with a big swing!  Probably the best Spider-Man movie to date.  It has everything you want from a movie...Not just a comic book movie, but any move.  It is 100% a must see!"
"Spider-Man continues to be the MCU's most consistent franchise with another satisfying story told using capable actors and dazzling special effects. There's not a lot that's new here, but it almost doesn't matter if the formula works this well."
"AMEI DEMAIS!!! Como eles juntaram todos, nossa! eu nem sou f√£ antiga, mas achei incrivel quando vi todos, junto com a sala inteira do cinema. Por√©m, para quem nao acompanha hqs nem le sobre os personagens, assim como eu, podem pensar que isso tudo poderia ter sido evitado. Mas se entendermos melhor os personagens e sobre a filosofia de cada um, essas coisas a√≠, conseguimos ver que as a√ß√µes fazem jus aos personagens no momento. Sobre outro ponto, os efeitos especiais, nao gostei muito, na minha opniao parece animacao de jogos. Nao achei tao real."
"Ok. O filme √© at√© bom pra assistir. Mas com o passar do tempo voc√™ n√£o consegui mais assistir por ficar muito chato .O filme n√£o tem uma cena memor√°vel, N√£o que um filme tenha que ter uma cena memor√°vel, mas vamos concordar que todos os filmes dos homens aranha tem uma cena memor√°vel, como a morte da Guen, o homem aranha parando um trem, entre outras. Mas o vil√£o desce filme salva um pouco o filme ,ele atua bem e o roteiro trabalha bem ele. Eu recomendo assistir o filme a noite e depois de uns meses assistir de novo."
This is the best spiderman movie ever.
"It was amazing movie, the best for Spider-Man ever! Great final scenes! Can't wait for next movie."
Reached every expectation and did not disappoint.
"Excelente filme, ja √© um dos meus prediletos!"
Great entertainment and escapism.
A must see experience in theatre recommended for everyone.
Verry love this film.
Phim nay hay nhung hoi buon:<<
"Long time fans will like it but as someone who saw Spider-Man 1 and nothing beyond, the story was derivative, stretches credulity, has none of the charm of the original, and seems to have as its primary objective bringing together a bunch of former actors for a feel good half hour reconciliation tour. Meh."
"The plotline isn't anything spectacular, however, that's not what this movie is for. The movie is basically just the setup for future movies (Post-credit scenes are also set-ups) but it's still a good watch. Basically, Tom Holland's Spider-Man is the new Iron Man for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
La mejor pel√≠cula de Spider-Man y la actuaci√≥n de Tom Holland y el desarrollo del personaje en esta pel√≠cula es INCRE√çBLE.
"I can't remember what I had written here, I messed it up somehow when I was leaving a review for No Way Home. So yeah, I enjoyed this movie and it's still one I need to rewatch, because I haven't seen it again since I originally watched it in theaters. I enjoyed it."
10/10 I was so amazed by the CGI and I loved the movie so much.
Spiderman? .... Nop..
This is the best Spiderman movie.
"I'm so glad to see Tobey, Andrew and Tom together."
The most ambitious and best Spider-Man movie ever made.
"great cast, a ""coulda be great"" movie  because the director sucks. no epicness, no great scenes, man you got Tobbey and Andrew and ...this entrance, seriously?  no memorable scenes or music. MCU needs right now good directors with a vision, with drama, with epicness again."
Really great movie ! The best Spider-Man movie ever ! Better and higher than any of my expectations.
The end is a little too bittersweet but it was so good ! Worth the wait and the money.
"Iconic for any spiderman fan. However, the screenplay is quite simple...the whole plot its developed by a rejection from MIT. Additionally, the Villains are just categorized as crazy characters, with no further development."
""
"Notwhistanding, the movie plays with the spiderman fan in a sweet form, and, for that complex labour, the movie gets a 4/5."
"It doesn't capture the essence of Spider-Man, only at the end he kind of behaves like a true hero, he likes the power but not the responsibility. After the events of homecoming, infinity war, and endgame, he should really be a bit more mature but he isn't, the only acceptable part is the final fight in London, the rest ir trash."
"This movie stinks, whoever wrote it Started with the notion to have all three Spider-Man in one movie and then just kind of wrote the script trying to get to that end. In other words it was extremely forced. The movie also relies on special effects because the story and dialogue are extremely weak. They introduce four villains into the movie who are supposed to be extremely powerful but yet somehow get dealt with in about 10 minutes, This movie was lame from start to finish"
Dumb downed the characters for the plot. Not a remarkable villain.
"Very entertaining movie, but with a terrible plot that gives a setback in the development of Spiderman and Peter Parker ... one of the WORST things are secondary characters like Flash or MJ ... bad bad bad"
Spider-Man: Far from Home improves more of the action and plot of Homecoming - and should be another Spider-Man treat.
"Lighthearted, nostalgic, great effects. Plot is simple, and it's so male-dominated that it feels like they could have cut out all scenes of Zendaya and the movie would still be pretty much the same."
Tom Holland is brilliant but the movie is not. Pretty cool fight scenes with Mysterio but other than that not that great.
"Look, this movie wasn't worth it, but the ending was great and gave way to the next Miranha movie"
a decent movie but most importantly - Tom Holland's Spider-Man here continues to be an annoying wimp...
It was okay............
The first impression I had of this movie I thought it was more ''bad''
"That's cool, but when I left the theater I was blown away by the movie and especially with the credits when the mystery showed that Peter Parker is Spider-Man I thought it was really fun, but the whole movie is fun, lots of jokes and lots of things. if there is an opportunity to watch this movie again, i would watch it"
I just in love with this movie!
"""People, they need to believe. And nowadays, they'll believe anything."" Well ain't that right."
""
"Compared to the first, this was a big step up in terms of action and grandiosity. Full of explosions and awesome Spider-Man swinging. The effects were magnificent. I can't help being a little boy and be amazed by it."
""
"Character-wise there wasn't a lot of improvement from the previous. Peter's friends are mostly there for comedy, but they are a source of vulnerability to Peter. Like in Amazing Spider-Man, the romance is very spontaneous, which of course is no where as investing as in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, but I still liked them anyway because of the actors. Mr. villain was pretty cool, but wouldn't be if Jake didn't play. Literally Jake can just breathe in a movie and I'll like that movie."
""
"Overall, it was still a great experience even with a rewatch. 8-8.5/10"
"Muy regular pel√≠cula, me parece la peor pel√≠cula de Spider-man y cada vez se extra√±a mas la esencia del personaje. La historia no me gusto, muy predecible desde el comienzo y realmente no pasa nada relevante hasta la escena post-cr√©ditos. Todos los personajes secundarios en esta pel√≠cula fueron insoportables y algunos como Ned perdieron el carisma que ten√≠an. En vez de presentarnos un elenco de personajes acompa√±antes como en otras adaptaciones, tenemos a este grupo super inclusivo e insoportable de compa√±eros de colegio. El villano de la pel√≠cula es Quentin Beck/Mysterio, un gran villano en mi opini√≥n aunque su revelaci√≥n me parece muy predecible si tenes alguna idea del personaje, a pesar de que me gusta que si no sabes el trasfondo del personaje te llevas un gran giro de trama; su dise√±o me gusto mucho y me encanto como lo manejaron principalmente en las escenas de acci√≥n. Pero volviendo a Peter, me parece un total irresponsable en esta pel√≠cula, sin querer meterse en la misi√≥n que le propone Nick Fury solo para estar con la chica que le gusta y adem√°s d√°ndole los lentes al villano de la pel√≠cula de una manera tont√≠sima que solo este Spider-man podr√≠a hacer. Adem√°s, el personaje se la pasa de ac√° para all√° usando sus poderes en momentos que no tienen que ser usados, por ejemplo en la escena del autob√∫s, donde mueve el volante y tranquilamente podr√≠a haber matado a todos; o en esa misma escena us√°ndolos y teniendo la precauci√≥n de que alguien lo pueda ver; o ni hablar de todas las veces que va sin mascara usando los poderes como si nada, poniendo en riesgo su identidad. Pero bueno, algo positivo de la pel√≠cula es que es muy entretenida en todo momento a pesar de muchas cosas sin sentido y muchas escenas que solo est√°n de relleno. Otra cosa buena son las escenas de acci√≥n, tremendamente hechas y con los mejores efectos especiales de una pel√≠cula del personaje; principalmente la escena de la ilusi√≥n de Mysterio o la del sentido ar√°cnido son de lo mejor.  Como ya dije, lo √∫nico relevante son las escenas post-cr√©ditos, las cuales son buen√≠simas y dejan preguntas sobre que es lo que va a pasar en el futuro del UCM, tanto en la tercera pel√≠cula de Spider-man, como en otras cintas. En conclusi√≥n, una pel√≠cula muy regular, con el peor Spider-man del cine y la peor pel√≠cula del personaje; a pesar de ser una historia muy entretenida, pero llena de escenas de relleno y personajes insufribles. La recomiendo solo porque entretiene y sirve para pasar el rato."
"This movie was Definitely better than ""Homecoming"" with a better plot following Peter on an European Adventure shortly after the events of ""Avengers:Endgame"", a great villain and that twist ending is sure to lead in the Fantastic ""No Way Home ;)"
Ein echt toller Film hatte wirklich Spa√ü mit dem. Einer meiner Lieblings MCU Filme
Hilarious and emotional its great
Mysterio is a good villain and happy and may are hilarious.
It just feels more like a Avengers who will become the next iron man than spider man far from home
"A solid, fun marvel movie with a couple surprises.  I never felt like the stakes were too high and some of the characters seemed cartoonish/one-dimensional."
it's not as good as NWH or homecoming but it's still really good 8/10
"Una buena pelicula me gusto mucho mas que la primera y el manejo de personajes, claro que Nick Fury le falta algo, pero de hay esta bien... Estaba increible que si mencionaron como Tony Start se sacrifico por el mundo, no como en otras peliculas que es como si odiaran al personaje."
"TWISTS! TRICKS! SPIDERMAN FLIPS! Everything in a Spiderman film turned up by 100 notches by the touch/feeling of a MCU movie. Jake performing at peak once again, and doing a great job, and Tom spoiling in the meantime! And this isn't the best Spiderman film!?!?!?"
"The movie itself is good, but the villain is one of the worst I've seen in my life."
"fun, but not a good movie it just seems like marvel and sony want to make nothing more than money with this iconic and memorable hero, the movie direction is disappointing as it doesn't make the hero drama interesting."
"Who said teen movies can't be quality movies? This film, which I consider one of the best 3 films of the Spider (after the first two by Raimi) combines romance, introspection, responsibility and dystopian reality in an excellent way, capturing the essence of Peter Parker even outside the New York context. Top 10 MCU."
"Uau isso realmente foi podre. O que mais o filme tem, n√£o √© drama, n√£o √© desenvolvimento de personagem, cenas de a√ß√µes bem aceit√°veis, √© piada, o filme se encarrega de fazer piadas cada meio segundo, eles s√≥ se esqueceram que o humor proposto consegue ser t√£o infantil, que uma crian√ßa de 6 anos se sentiria vergonha ao se deparar com isso. Fazendo o restante da experi√™ncia se tornar tortuosa."
A teenager superhero for a teenager's audience
"Decent Spiderman film this one. I often find them super cheesy and find that film is a bit saturated with average superhero films these day, but this one stood out, it's cool, definitely worth a watch."
"While not being as good as the first one this sequel is still entretaining and fun with a lot of action, some awesome effects and a great villian."
"Tom Holland continues to be the most relatable spiderman.  In his disaster of a school trip, the audience continues to be captivated by humor, action, reliability, and storyline.  Definitely recommend."
Not a whole lot to say. Marvel knows how to make a Spider-Man film
A solid entry into the Tom Holland Spider-Man catalogue.
Really good movie like always with marvel‚Ä¶ but I really don't like Jake gyllanhaal so it was good that he's the bad guy.
"Far From Home is surprisingly funny and clever. It's execution and writing shine and allow you the space to not only examine Peter's struggle of balancing his heroic and personal life, but to introspect into your own at the same time. The ability for the movie to explore this mature topic, but in a lighthearted manner are what make it memorable and enjoyable to experience."
"Surprisingly good. I was really disappointed when I saw Homecoming. It just didn't feel like a Spiderman movie and was a bit on the lackluster side. I had certain expectations and I suppose Homecoming helped me know what to expect from its sequel. With that in mind I really had a good time with this film. Its a fun small neighborhood film with a really good villain. They nailed Mysterio in the film. I loved how they portrayed his character and I loved his costume. I was surprised just how close they got to the comics with it. I am glad the days of trying to subdue or gritt-ify superhero costumes are somewhat over (still holding out for Wolverine to get his comic book costume). Ideas of certain superheroes are kind of goofy and so are the costumes. It's part of the fun. Certainly adapt so it doesn't look super goofy but don't destroy either. Overall I would recommend giving it a watch. Holland still isn't my ideal Spiderman, nor is his world, but I enjoy it for what it is. And I am so glad they got rid of Spiderman's AI voice. Helps him feel less like Iron Man lite and more like Spiderman."
Jake Gyllenhaal is a freah villian and would love to see him keep coming back!
"I don't know who this movie was about, but it didn't seem like spider-man. The best scene by far was when Tom Holland was fighting Mysterio inside his illusions. I thought the drones were a dumb take on how Mysterio creates illusions and once again MJ just isn't MJ."
"muito bom ,engra√ßado e uma cena pos credito incrivel"
"This was an unpredictable blend of teen romance and superhero action, setting the stage for the next era of the MCU.  It starts as a charming teen road trip comedy that turns into a superhero movie.  The cast was excellent and Jake Guyllenhaal nails his characters forthrightness."
"Nice show with the spider, and Tom Holland is good actor for this role."
"que hermosa pelicula de romance juvenil, accion drama y super heroes, cada producci√≥n de Marvel es especial de principio a fin"
It's a Spiderman movie. But not the best.
"The idea of Edith was dumb, too much CGI yet again, and the story was meh. Sure Spiderman had reasons to feel tired, especially after Endgame, but each movie he strays from being a good independent Spiderman. Definitely overhyped."
5 star movie all the way. tom holland knows the role and delivers yet again!
"Great movie, Holland is great. Maybe got a little bit on the childish end at some points, but it rebounded nicely in other aspects. Just need to get away from tony stark villains now."
"Though I love the film for its criticism of other marvel movies, I will never forgive it for the way it wasted Jake Gyllenhaal's masterful acting talents on a rather forgettable villain, making a potentially interesting story into a bland, generic marvel cartoon."
""
Final Rating: 72/100
"The potential of this film was destroyed, the villain was literally just another Iron Man villain, and the CGI was overdone to the point of sickness. ""Spiderman: Far From Home"" was just a disappointment when compared to the other Spiderman films throughout the years, and is, in my opinion, one of the lower ones. The humor is still good enough, the action is done well, and Holland continues to play his role marvelously. However, despite the positive things I have to say about this film, there was still enough yuck to bog this down, and especially when compared to ""Spiderman: Homecoming,"" this film doesn't even compare."
I have a lot to say.
I am a huge Spider Fan a Huge MCU fan.
The number of people that know Peter Secret identity is Outrageously high so it doesn't feel like watching a spider man story. The Whole Teenage movie Recipe Clich√©. The Character Dialogue try to copy the one from the early marvel Iron man movie.. and fail because they have nothing to say to each other. The Teacher is the best part of the movie. The pitch meeting for this movie should have been very differently .. You think Peter can go back to a normal life after the event of Infinity War.. I know marvel wants to Elongate the story but darn it felt wrong.
You know from the beginning who Misterio is.. So nothing is a surprise .. Kinda dum that Sony want to make a Misterio movie since sooo long. He's really not an interesting character. At least he was well played.
Again to many love scene and goofy scene. We will we ever have a spider man movie without love scene that never ends ..i rather watch a 45 minute movie that is good than 2h movie that just pointless boring story with multiple plot hole just to insert character that you really don't care about. Fake Fury team look like the Nebucad Nezar team from Matrix and they are super Cringe .. Movie is dull make no sense . Do you really think the Skrull can be this Dum.
Its like if Peter did not learn anything from all his adventure in the past few years.
He has 0 sense of responsibility  .
"Homecoming was the best Spiderman movie.. why did it turn this way Why did Peter gave Edith to Misterio ,,,"
And the END with J Jonas Alex Jones Jameson is simply ridiculous it made me lost all interest in the continuity because we all know what comes next..
Just like in the Infinity Saga (2012-13) in the comics. that will keep going on with dr strange /
Happy Plus Aunt may = Cringe
I seem to be alone to think that this was a bad representation of who Peter Parker is. But i own 9000+ comic book  and I'm not living in USA so  what do i know
This is my least favorite MCU movie and i am serious. I gave one star for acting and cast because it was a good cast . and another star for the score BGM and FX.
"The three missing star are Story/Plot hole  , General Entertainment, Personal overall Feeling about the movie."
the perfect spider-man movie
I'm not one of these people to follow the crowd and say a films good just because I'm a fan boy or girl that just likes the actors. The films are all getting repetitive and I'm really not a fan of Tom Hollands acting it's like watching plank from Ed  Ed and eddy. The only things that make the films bearable is the good cgi and money that goes into them. I feel like the older spiderman movies could of been so much better with this sort of budget and a decent director. The films bow have the money to put on a big show but feel rushed and repetitive.
Molto molto molto bello
this movie is trash compared to tobey and andrew spiderman movies
amazing spider-action and funny movie
Good watch and enjoyed it
This movie was really good that i watched this 5 times.So imagine how good it is
"Infelizmente esse filme n√£o me agradou como esperava. As premissas que prometiam que ele fosse √≥timo foram podadas uma a uma. Esse filme talvez seja o √∫nico da Marvel sem prop√≥sito algum. Nada dele contribui para o UCM. Uma √∫nica e curta cena p√≥s-cr√©dito fez mais que o filme inteiro. Quando assisti ele no cinema, sai da sala derrotado. Sai do cinema triste pelo dinheiro gasto no ingresso. Esse filme n√£o faz jus as notas que possui!"
Loved the post credit scene. Little slow in the first bit of the movie. Wish we got more web slinging scenes at the end and they should've added the deleted scene against the criminals in the restaurant. Really see what that Iron-Spider suit can do.
""
Can't wait for NWH.
Amazing! Excited all the way through!!
The Spiderman Series contiues to be a fresh and innovative additon to the MCU. Tom Holland continues to be a charming lead while Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Mysterio is a threatening and interesting villain. The EDITH glasses storyline though just wasn't right there for me however.
"I still wish the MCU films were more serious, but it's enjoyable and fun all the way through"
the extended version  should be the Original version
"While the MCU Spider-Man films aren't quite as memorable or genuine as the Raimi films, Spider-Man Far From Home is none the less fun, humorous, and has an awesome end credit sequence."
"Compared to this movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on another level. Far From Home is in general a decent film, but the two most important parts are bad-written: the protagonist and the villain. Tom Holland's Peter Parker involuted, becoming an idiot teenager who wants to run away from his responsibilities to conquer the girl he likes. Where is the guy who wants to prove himself? The guy who wants to be more than the neighbourhood friend? And Mysterio's plan and motivations don't make any sense. Luckily, he's imposing and Jake Gyllenhall is a stunning actor. The humour is more basic and less intelligent, but almost as efficient as Homecoming. And what elevates the level of this film is the third act, which is for sure one of the best acts in the whole MCU. The visual effects are amazing (by the way, the movie plays with them smartly) and the final fight is MCU's best individual fight (only one hero against the villain). Tom Holland and Zendaya's romance may seem forced, but it makes sense, they have chemistry and fortunately, the script kept MJ's cynical personality. No other character but Peter has been distorted. Oh, and I loved the mid-credits scene, it's possibly Marvel's best cliffhanger."
"Funny, sweet and upbeat MCU entry. Despite it relying so heavily on other MCU characters to add plot, ‚ÄúFar from Home‚Äù is a splendid sequel with a smart (and humorous) villain."
EDITH is worth remembering for
So Fresh: Absolute Must See!
Great movie. Follows up the first nicely and fits into the universe well. Even if you don‚Äôt know marvel like that you won‚Äôt find yourself lost though. Twists of the movie are well done and it makes for a movie that‚Äôs phenomenal the first time but slightly less enjoyable every time after cause you know them. Still great movie
Genuinely enjoyed watching!
"I don't really love this movie, it's not that great... But it's fun. 6/10"
"Inconsistent pacing, uninteresting villain, muddled themes and a general lack of direction makes this one of the more forgettable MCU movies."
Not very original. This was the worst Spiderman movie
"Pior filme do Homem-Aranha. De Volta ao Lar √© muito melhor e amadurece mais o personagem, pena que essa sequ√™ncia joga tudo no lixo."
"I thought this was pretty bad. Started out promising, but definitely went sour by the end. I think this is the worst Spiderman out of the three modern actors that have played him."
Jon Watts you beast.
It is a very entertaining blockbuster. Although the storyline isn't perfect. There is definitely a whole lot to enjoy.
Hasnt the world had enough superhero movies???
Good effects but boring predictable plot with annoying teen romance thrown in
"I had to wait to watch this until after I had seen ""Avengers: Endgame"".  It continued to be true to it's franchise.  I enjoyed it.  I'm glad Disney & Sony worked out their contractual issues to keep Spider-Man in the MCU."
The best spiderman so fast!
"Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal make this a worthy Spidey adventure for the ages, and the permanent change that Watts makes to Peter's status quo is fantastic."
A good sequel but not as good as the first movie. Mysterio is a decent villain who gets the job done and the movie had a pretty nice twist at the end
"It's definitely an improvement over the last one, but I still can't help but feel bad for it. I want love it, but the movie still feels incomplete. The story is good and perfectly executed at times, but it also feels way too rushed and doesn't leave enough room to properly connect with these characters. It's far from awful, but I can't say I'd watch it again any time soon."
"10/10 best Spider-Man yet! This movie was very interesting and it really is memorable and I think it‚Äôs funny, intense, the acting is pretty good and the ending is just, wow. That‚Äôs all I gotta say. Great movie and you better watch it."
"I like Tom Holland, but this was a bit lame. The plot was pretty stupid and villain guy wasn't great"
Wow!!! Amazing. Better than 1st one.

I loved it! So fresh!
"Tom Holland has really captured the self-doubt and innocence of a teenage Peter Parker as unlikely teams up with Mysterio (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) to fight CGI creatures. The premise seemed quite lame to me at first but as any Spider-Man fan knows, Mysterio can not be trusted. Far From Home not only has one of the most fleshed out and interesting villains in the MCU but it also manages to maintain several storylines such as blossoming teen-romance, loss, pressure to perform and still is action packed and entertaining. I also was glad to see a J. Jonah Jameson cameo in the mid-credits scene."
"I do not like this film. I love Spider-Man I loved Homecoming and I'm a big fan of the character as a whole but I really dislike the latest Spidey movie I actually think I dislike this film more than I do Spider-Man 3 or even The Amazing Spider-Man 2. That's not to say there isn't things I liked, I liked the idea of Mysterio being a team of people rather than just one man with Jake Gyllenhaal's character being the face of the Team."
""
"I was not a fan of any of the new Spidey costumes in this flick including the ""Night Monkey"" suit & the Red & Black suit, I really hate the red & black suit with a passion from this movie. I am not a fan of drones being the main threat for this film"
""
I did however like the twist ending with J. Jonah Jameson & Parkers face reveal. Other than a few things I really did not enjoy this movie and I will rarely watch it again.
"An awesome movie with a perfect main character with perfect themes started in the Avengers movie, a very well written story of Spiderman who in the previous movie wanted to grow up to be a superhero as fast as possible, but after seeing what that entails he tries to become a regular hero from the neighborhood in this movie. Very well written side characters, very good love story with MJ. Awesome action scenes with the performance of the illusion, just wow"
"Lazy script and plot, so many unnecesary jokes, it feels like a spiderman parody, the only good thing was the hoy aunt may"
"it seems funny that this movie is the second best rated by the public. it's fun to watch, but nothing more than that."
"Well acted and fun character writing, this film nevertheless struggles severely with structural issues and ideas that simply do not work."
"A confirmation that without Tony's tech, Peter is absolutely nothing."
"They started the movie with lame jokes. It was filled with lame jokes. He didn't like MJ in the first 1 but suddenly he wants her in the 2nd? EDITH has to be one of the worst plot points to ever be in a MCU movie. He's SPIDER-MAN, the whole ""future iron-man"", globtrotting schtick is pretty lame."
"Mysterio is one of MCU's top tier villian, Tom Holland did an amazing job potraying the character, stunning visual especially the illusion scene, Marvel best third act fight since Endgame. MCU spider-man's arc harks back to the early Stan Lee&Ditko run on the character."
"lixo completo, pura vergonha alheia"
This movie is good but bad at the same time I really enjoyed the movie I give it an 8 out of 10 I enjoyed watching it and was definitely something different he defeated mysterio with no tech whatsoever and I really enjoyed it to be honest he has defeated every villain without tech and he's till gets hate and after he defeated mysterio Peter And Mj finally kissed I loved that scene this movie was great and that post credit scene was so unexpected and then nick fury and maris well sirios like what I can't wait for No Way Home everybody is coming back and that will be iconic i absolutely recommend this movie
A good Spiderman movie that perfectly balances the akward teenager side and the superhero side.
This movie had great visuals absolutely amazing definitely the best in the MCU.
The movie also gives us more screen time of Peter a very welcome suprise as Tom plays Peter perfectly.
The issue with this movie is the story is weak with the Mysterio twist being far too predictable and yet again too much dependence on ironman which weakens the movie significantly.
I absolutely loved this Definitely top 10 but the plot and reliance on Ironman weighs it down
"Well directed and acted, but the story and setup in this MCU sequel is just unintriguing. Another Tony Stark derived villain played well by Jake Gyllenhaal,  but we don't really get to see him go head to head with Spiderman physically or in ideologies like we saw with Michael Keeton's Vulture in the previous installment."
""
This movie is so oversaturated with drone battles that I just lost all emotional investment. The most interesting plot point in the movie is the cliff hanger at the very end.
""
High hopes for No Way Home still.
"Overall great cast, bolstered by stellar performances from Holland and Gyllenhaal. Holland all but solidifies himself as the best Spider-Man/Peter Parker we have seen. A lot of homage to the great characters, all while adding in some new twists. Great movie."
"A very fun film overall without any major flaws. Although expected, the plot goes in the right directions. However, the intention to keep the scale small slightly exceeds the limit and I would have wished the illusion battle was at the very end instead or repeated, because that would not have lost its originality even if repeated a dozen times."
A great movie that is very nice passing of the torch movie make this a fun watch and helps it continue Spider-man's journey and the next era of the MCU.
"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is definitely better. But this movie sorta holds up. But why do the first two villains in this trilogy not have an actual conflict with Peter? Everyone wants to get revenge on TONY, not the MAIN PROTAGANIST. The moral is supposed to be ""Don't try to be something you're not"", but Spider-Man ends this movie with a decked out Iron Man suit ready for the next fight. Remember the times when Spider-Man used to actually do things himself, and not rely on a billionaire super-hero? God, I miss Tobey."
