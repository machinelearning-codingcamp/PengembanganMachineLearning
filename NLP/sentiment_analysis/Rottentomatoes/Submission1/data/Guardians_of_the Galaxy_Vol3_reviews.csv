Review
Emotional with great action and a beautiful ending.
while the movie is one of the only modern marvel movies that are good. it does not feel whole in some ways.
One of the best superhero movies
Perfect ending to the series.
"Creo que esta es mi favorita de la trilog√≠a. Los personajes fueron tan encantadores de princ√≠pio a fin (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ) pero llor√© tantoo, es una de las pel√≠culas que m√°s me ha hecho llorar, con la historia de Rocket y pr√°cticamente todas las escenas con animales me dio tanta pena que llor√© muchisimo..."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a film that thrives on emotional manipulation, nostalgia, and character-driven moments, but ultimately falters under a weak script and inconsistent storytelling. While it delivers some great highs‚Äîparticularly Rocket‚Äôs tragic backstory‚Äîit leans so heavily on these emotional beats that it masks the movie‚Äôs deeper flaws."
""
"One of the biggest letdowns is the mishandling of Adam Warlock, a character who was hyped up for years but ends up being completely wasted. His role in the story is nearly meaningless, reduced to a man-child sent to retrieve Rocket, only to serve as a last-minute redemption arc in the film‚Äôs final act. His presence feels tacked on rather than essential, and his motivations are paper-thin."
""
"The High Evolutionary is a strong villain in terms of performance, but his actual plan lacks depth. He wants to create a ‚Äúperfect society,‚Äù yet destroys his own creation without hesitation. His character is menacing, but his actions feel contradictory, making him less compelling than previous Guardians villains."
""
"Peter Quill‚Äôs lack of his signature helmet is another glaring issue. James Gunn‚Äôs explanation that Quill ‚Äúforgot it in a drawer‚Äù is weak at best, and it‚Äôs clear that the decision was made purely for dramatic effect in the film‚Äôs climax. Star-Lord nearly dies in space‚Äîonly to be saved by Adam Warlock in an unnecessary redemption moment that could have been avoided if Gunn had simply stuck to established character traits."
""
"The movie also suffers from low stakes. This was marketed as the final Guardians movie, yet none of the core characters die or face any lasting consequences. While the emotional sendoff works for some, it feels underwhelming considering the build-up. The ending, where the team simply disbands, lacks the impact that Guardians 2 had with Yondu‚Äôs sacrifice."
""
"That said, the film isn‚Äôt without its strengths. The action sequences are great, especially the hallway fight scene, and the soundtrack once again delivers. The real standout is Rocket‚Äôs story‚Äîhis past is heart-wrenching, and his final act of saving the animals is one of the best moments in the entire trilogy. However, this also plays into the film‚Äôs biggest issue: it relies on Rocket‚Äôs emotional backstory so much that it distracts from the weak main plot. A standalone Rocket project might have allowed for better storytelling while giving Volume 3 a stronger focus."
""
"At the end of the day, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an enjoyable film for longtime fans but doesn‚Äôt hold up under deeper scrutiny. It feels like audiences are more in love with the idea of the Guardians rather than the actual execution of this movie. While it has heart, it lacks the narrative strength of Volume 1 and Volume 2, making it a decent but flawed farewell."
"Taking the team in a darker direction without sacrificing heart or humor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ends the trilogy on an entertaining high note."
Best final for this trilogy. Love this movie
I honestly can't recall what it was about.  Another cookie cutter movie from the MCU.  It wasn't good.
Absolute must-see!  Like website says
"This is probably in the top 3 of the mcu, this movie has everything emotial, action sequences, every place, every character is well written and a great ending for the trilogy,"
I hope we are going see them again in some future marvel project.
THANK YOU JAMES ü•≤üòÅ
Great movie
I wish High Evolutionary was more of a threat in the movie
but well I had fun watching the movie
the easter eggs and details hatsoff
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a wonderful one last hurrah for our rag-tag family, providing scenes that will make us shed a couple tears."
"Actually, it is far better than recent marvel productions. Not sure that I liked it because of my low expectancy, but it is really chill nice movie. As I said it is definitely better than recent super hero movies, yet still don't expect too much."
"Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 3 is James Gunn at his best. Rockets story is finally told with such great emotion. This movie is what I hope to see out of him in the DCU. It is a step up from Vol. 2 in every way, it is funnier without trying to be funny, it has more emotion and Drax finally got some character development. I love this movie. Best of the trilogy: 94%"
This movie was good. I always like the GOTG but I didn‚Äôt like that groot didn‚Äôt have a good role and rocket wasn‚Äôt alive almost the whole movie. Good movie but also sad
Possibly the best of the GOTG series!!!
Flawless movie. The best since endgame
"Just as always, James Gunn pulls on our emotional strings with a farewell to the team of wierdos called The Guardians of the Galaxy - a movie made with extreme attention to detail, a well written story and well rounded character arcs, and innovative action that leaves you with a fulfilled heart and smile on your face as you step out of the theatre. Totally recommend it."
simply put .... the best üëåüèæ üëçüèæ üòç ü¶ù
one of the best animated films of all time. looking forward to the next film to complete Miles trilogy.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is unexpectedly heart-breaking. The story feels fresh and the cinematography is great.
""
"The character development is incredible. I love that we got to see Rocket's origin story and it is gut-wrenching. This was the most depressing MCU movie since Avengers: Endgame or Spider-Man: No Way Home. The Peter-Gamora relationship is interesting. The themes of family, facing your fears are great. The dialogues are outstanding in Marvel standards, Drax and Matnis' interactions are priceless. Even Kraglin had an arc in the movie, which was predictable, but enjoyable to watch. The story is intriguing, very character driven, which is rare in the MCU. The villain has his reasons, but I think they're weak. Not the best in the franchise, but definitely not the worst."
""
"The cinematography is especially great with a lot of long or spinning shots, I loved it. Although I think the movie could've been a little shorter. The visual effects are amazing, with wonderful production design. The casting is great, even though I think a bigger name for the villain would've helped the movie more. The acting performances are spectacular, especially Bradley Cooper and Sean Gunn as Rocket."
""
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 could be the best MCU movie if it had a better villain and a little shorter runtime.
"Since I wasn't really a fan and was sort of unfamiliar with the other two films I came at this as a stand-alone movie. I loved it. It had heart, something the other Marvel films lack."
""
"The weirdo characters and the breakup of the original team is heart-rending and lovely. I cried and laughed. Gunn got to me. And now I want to see what else, perhaps, he can come up with."
""
Most enjoyable.
"All the previous movies made me laugh, but this one ? This time I cry and think about the friends I have, the places I feel like I'm part of my guardians of the galaxy."
""
"Finding your place in the world, facing what hurts you, dealing with yourself and your demons is what the movie told me."
""
Be you and find your small place in the world by doing good to the people around you.
Que film√£o nossa n√£o me arrependo de nada ter assistido esse filme incr√≠vel amei
"The third and final installment in Marvel‚Äôs Guardians of the Galaxy arc hits home where the majority of other Multiverse Saga films have flopped. This film is a character study focused on Rocket the Raccoon, a bold and surprising choice from Marvel Studios. We learn all about Rocket‚Äôs past, how a normal raccoon became a science experiment, and it all comes back to pose a serious threat to the Galaxy. CONTINUE READING ON LETTERBOXD: https://boxd.it/66L0hR"
Beautiful send off to a great franchise.
Melhor filme da Marvel( at√© o momento)!
"Incredible how a movie can be so light-hearted, inspiring, action packed, and gut wrenching all in one. I managed to go from laughing hysterically to crying uncontrollably several times over. One of those very rare instances where the sequel is far greater than the preceding movies. wow."
James Gunn is the goat
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was the perfect conclusion to the trilogy. One of the things I loved is that it felt like that: the conclusion to its own trilogy as opposed to another entry in a long-running story like the third Ant-Man or Captain America. This movie took everything great about the first two movies and improved on it.
""
"As the conclusion to the trilogy, the movie gave satisfying, well-earned closure to each of our main characters. Each character had their own arc in the film (a feat that can be hard to accomplish in an ensemble movie like this) that fit with what we‚Äôve seen before, felt like a natural progression, and went to a fulfilling place. Not only that, but the arcs are intertwined in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave the movie feeling messy."
""
"Anyone who saw this movie‚Äôs trailers or poster releases could tell that Rocket was going to get a spotlight in this movie, but we couldn‚Äôt have predicted how well-earned that spotlight would be. Rocket really shines in this movie in a way that makes him feel more like the star of the show than Star-Lord (although Star-Lord gets plenty of time to shine, too)."
""
"As anyone familiar with the series would expect, the soundtrack of the movie was excellent. James Gunn has a talent for choosing songs that really fit the tone of the story/scene and including them in a way that feels natural. The way he transitions songs playing in-story into the soundtrack is especially notable."
""
"The cinematography in this movie was excellent. More often than not, you only notice the cinematography if its bad. When cinematography is good, you become immersed in the movie and tend not to notice it. However, sometimes a movie has cinematography so good that you can‚Äôt help but notice and appreciate it. That was how I felt during this movie. There were more than a few moments where I was taken aback by a particular shot."
""
"Of course, no Marvel movie would be complete without humor, but James Gunn reminds us that he was the one that really started that trend in the first Guardians. A lot of Marvel movies have a big problem with undercutting serious moments or scenes with humor, but this movie doesn‚Äôt really have that issue. The movie finds an incredible balance between humor and sincerity that allows the sincere moments to be sincere and create an opening for humor. The humor and sincerity work together rather than combatting one another."
""
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was not just a great Marvel movie or a great sequel, but a great movie. My only complaint is that the high bar this movie sets makes some other recent Marvel movies look worse than they already did by comparison."
Felt like original marvel
"‚ÄúRocket, Teefs, and Floor go now!  Rocket, Teefs, and Floor go now!‚Äù  Watch it and you‚Äôd better have some tissues to dab your crying eyes. I think it was the best, it gave us Rocket‚Äôs emotional backstory."
"A great finale to easily the best trilogy in the MCU. Everyone‚Äôs arcs come together so beautifully as their 3-film journey finally comes to an end. This is easily the darkest and most emotional of the trilogy, as the main conflict explores Rocket‚Äôs backstory with a huge emphasis on condemning animal cruelty. It's easily the most serious of the trilogy, but luckily there‚Äôs enough comedy that lands to balance the tone without sacrificing the character progress. I will say, I‚Äôll really miss this series, but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre ending on a high note with everyone‚Äôs arcs ending at the right spot (especially Gamora‚Äôs and Star Lord). Easily the best Marvel movie in years and a nice farewell to James Gunn‚Äôs run with Marvel."
"My first review on here. Just finished this movie and it was so good that i had to write a review and make an account. Everything about this movie is perfect, anyone can enjoy it."
Everyone that has reviewed the last two films as ‚Äúlighthearted fun‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been paying attention.
GotG is single handedly the best Marvel series to ever exist.
"All three films are the epitome of perfection,"
And the third is just as incredible as the last two.
""
"These 3 films are the pinnacle of the marvel universe, and anyone who says otherwise has no idea what cinema actually is."
"Sorry, avengers fanboys. üòÇ"
"It's not just good, it's amazing. I can't believe it but I just saw a comic turned into a movie and very well done too."
""
"There were questions of course, so many incognitas without answer, but to compile THIS MUCH and make the spectator feel every scene at this level while keeping it absolutely entertaining, is already deserving of praise."
""
"No really, I have no words to describe how much I liked this movie, I can't really pinpoint how it is but it is better than the other 2 for me, I guess it's the amount of touching moments."
"Wonderful 3rd chapter of this wacky sci-fi MCU franchise.  So much to love in this movie!  Great story, good character development, tons of fun and sometimes a bit heart-breaking."
"The Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy ends with a perfect story to wrap up the characters we know and love. With beautiful heart and love behind this, carefully sewn together by James Gunn and his crew, it is hard not to love all these characters. It is a beautiful movie that gives itself time to prepare you for the end, to show off these characters in a new light, and give you more depth to the most complex character of these movies. This movie is all about closure, and it gives you, the audience, the closure you need for this beloved Marvel family."
"Best marvel movie ever. It‚Äôs that simple. James Gunn just nails these comic book movies time and time again. He understands the characters, he can fit that weird fun comic vibe in with the dark and emotional undertones. He built this imperfect team throughout these movies and these are the most emotionally imperfect they‚Äôve ever been, and it works for each other. It brings a sense of reliance out on all these characters. And this movie truly brings out the best of them. It‚Äôs a perfect movie. In every way. Go watch it if you haven‚Äôt, now!"
This is the worst movie of the trilogy and that speaks to how consistently phenomenal the Guardians movies were.
I was looking forward to the 3rd installment of Guardians of the Galaxy because I am a big fan of the franchise but I was really disappointed & angry with #3 because I am a huge animal lover and I could not watch all the scene of torture & pain that go thru the movie. I know it's just animation but making young Rocket go thru all that made me sick and I just couldn't watch it.   Horrifying is a good word.
"Watch this movie, repeat repeat repeat."
"Fantasy is not about candy and popcorn, happy endings and what more..."
""
Fantasy is taking the high and lows of life above and below the human experience.
""
This movie delivers that concept.
""
There are parts so well twined that made my heart ache and chin shake.
""
"There are parts where I laughed and giggled, the actors didn't spoil a take."
""
"Incredible cast and performance, brilliant story telling."
"The sad, gruesome and disturbing scenes linger after watching it. I'm a huge fan of the first two, but this is a bit of a misfire."
"An amazing movie. It was very emotional, but just like all of the Guardians movies, Hilarious. One of the best movies of 2023, It makes you want to cry sometimes, but still great. I would give it an 81%"
I love this movie this movie is  perfection
the best mcu trilogy and the best 3rd film of an MCU trilogy. The Guardians are one of the best thing the MCU has ever done and brought to our screens. James Gunn better do right by DC.
Great backstory they made about rocket loved the movie
Immense HEART‚Ä¶
As well as the best MARVEL movie soundtrack since the original Guardians.
""
This was fitting end to what was a great franchise
Perfect threequel. Baby rocket is so cute too.
A brilliant conclusion to this trilogy with great humour balanced with mature and dark stories which are truly emotional.
""
Gunn makes the most if his last movie by teasing deaths and going all out to create a fantastic experience.
Soundtrack is always top notch. Great story line great movie
It is absolute garbage.
A sad but amazingly gorgeous film.
I am a huge fan of Guardians. I have never been a fan of any marvel or d.c. movies but this‚Ä¶it is a blessing to human kind. By far my favorite guardians movie and made me cry 10/10 would recommend.
These are always my favorites!
"Definately better than the 2nd movie, finally Rocket got some love. Hopefully they dont make anymore, then again its disney and they LOVE useless sequels"
Woah! I was surprised by this film. James Gunn said ‚ÄúYou want dark? Well here you go.‚Äù
The best of the guardian series for me. A tear jerker that really builds on some of the characters depth. Sets up possibilities for some great cosmic marvel action.
I‚Äôm sorry this is one of the worst marvel movies ever made avengers endgame ruined the entire marvel movie franchise and honestly I‚Äôve never liked any of the guardians of the galaxy movies volume 2 was absolute garbage and this one was very heartbreaking horrible and horrifying.
Werry good. A perfect send-off movie. Started return of marvel and it worked.
"√â o melhor filme que eu vi em 2024 (apesar de ser de 2023), trama muito boa, envolvente, excelente personagens, bom vil√£o, √© esse o tipo de filme que a Marvel precisa (n√£o esses lixos atuais)"
"Genius for its own sake, a beautiful ending to an excellent Marvel trilogy."
Everything is just perfect from the cast and the plot.
"I just enjoyed every moment, recommended to watch, this is a genius movie from start to finish."
I really enjoyed this movie..very good movie! 7.5/10
"Loved everything about this movie, really this movie didn't have anything bad that jumped out at me.  But being a film major, I did have two VERY SMALL problems with this movie, none of these problems make the movie unwatchable at all.  This is definitely in the top six best marvel movie is."
"My first problem was the beginning moved a little too fast for me, like they are living in nowhere and then all of sudden Rocket's almost dead.  It was really only the beginning that moved fast though, the rest of the movie was fine.  I think it felt like it moved fast because the entire beginning scene was super slo-mo, so when things started to happen, they felt like they were happening faster."
"My last problem was the ending with the song by Florence and the Machine.  While I really loved it, it felt like it lasted too long and it got a tiny bit cheesy.  But besides that the movie was phenomenal.  As I said, these problems didn't effect the way I looked at the movie, I still very much enjoyed this film and it was a great way to end the trilogy.  In all, I think this is a great family movie and THE saddest Marvel movie I have ever seen.  I hope to see at least some of these characters appear in Avengers Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars!"
"Sem d√∫vidas nenhuma o melhor filme dos guardi√µes da gal√°xia, um filme com com√©dia e logo depois o filme fica s√©rio, nunca pesei que iria chorar por um guaxinim."
The only thing is Adam Warlock is this whining teenager and i was hoping it would have been more comic book accurate. Still a great movie stay after the credits for the post credit scene.
Dire√ß√£o: Bom
Atua√ß√£o: Bom
Roteiro: Bom
Caracteriza√ß√£o: Bom
Soundtrack: Bom
good marvel film. what you'd expect from a guardians movie.
Finally depth! The best of the trilogy.
This was sad but loved it
"I thought this was gonna be another silly guardians of the galaxy movie, but wow I was not expecting the plot to be like the way it was"
Easily the best in the franchise and a fantastic way to end it.
"This was awesome, blast attic, and  really fun üòÄ I loved it, hoping volume 4 to come soon, I really did enjoy this one"
"Great movie. Beautiful graphics, actors who skillfully played their roles and, of course, small episodic actors. I watched it many times, all volumes <3"
Best! One last ride...magistral!
"A true masterpiece‚Äîa brilliant blend of story, visuals, and emotion that provides a perfect, heartfelt conclusion to our beloved Guardians. The film‚Äôs visual spectacle enhances every moment, making each scene feel larger-than-life, while the story resonates with both humor and depth. It‚Äôs not only the best film in the trilogy but also a remarkable ode to friendship, sacrifice, and heroism. A must-watch for fans and newcomers alike."
Awesome sauce! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!
"Good movie for sure, however I'm not sure anyone watched it in focus group, or an early cut because a lot of established things in here a just forgotten about (Starlord's helmet). Not the same way Game of thrones was but enough to be noticeable. I know Bautista is sliming down and wanting to be less the strong man but having him wear a shirt the whole movie is just against type."
"The Guardians of the Galaxy return for a fun but very emotional final bout that focuses much more on Rocket this time around. And the story, villain, action, and effects are all on full display thanks to James Gunn."
"The Guardians of the Galaxy deliver their swan song in Vol. 3 and it‚Äôs a rockin‚Äô good time. Rocket's tragic origins, great action and effects, and James Gunn's soulful style send them out on an emotional high note."
"After the previous marvel train wrecks (Thor L&T), it was really nice to see GOTG3 do a better job at keeping the audience both entertained and invested as it was a laugh from start to finish"
"‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‚Äù is a wonderful sendoff for everyone‚Äôs favorite ragtag group of misfits that is equal parts hilarious, heartbreaking, bittersweet, and satisfying."
"The Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is a series that consistently improved as each movie released, improving elements that didn't work in the prior release."
"Love all three, great and entertaining. Shame its looks like its come to an end."
big marvel fan always great to see the guardians
The best marvel movie to date. Cannot recommend more
"It was perfect,perfect everything down to the last my minute detail"
This was my introduction to the marvel franchise and now probably my favourite marvel film out there
Perfect trilogy and Chris Pratt gave an amazing performance as always as well as the rest of the cast!
"It was one of the best, if not the best movie that I've seen in theaters, as well as being the best in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and one of the greatest movies in the MCU and just MARVEL in general. This was the most fun I've ever had at the movies."
"Best of the series, and told with true emotion which many recent Marvel movies lack. Ended the series on the highest note possible. Well done!"
not bad but this is the worst film of the trilogy
That is a great trilogy now in existence‚Äî If you loved the forst two movies then here‚Äôs the cherry on top!
Absolutely amazing and so much fun!
"Excellent movie, the best part three movie of the whole MCU."
The best Guardians movie.
"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 suffers from numerous plot holes, dialogue issues, and pacing problems that would require an essay to fully dissect. It feels like it was written by a teenager who only knows bad jokes and enjoys yelling at others. This installment is a disappointing descent from the heartwarming charm of the first movie, making it painful to watch till the end. It's frustrating to witness how each subsequent installment seems to exponentially worsen. What a pity."
Cada d√≠a valoro mas est√° pel√≠cula
Even Spy Kids was better.
All three of these films are a must for anyone's collection of space Sci fi. thoroughly enjoyed watching. Awesome acting with plenty of witty action. Funny as hell to boot.
"This might be my favorite MCU movie, they nailed the ending to this trilogy"
"Filme fant√°stico, respeitando toda a hist√≥ria, um desfecho sensacional, melhor filme da marvel. Superou qualquer expectativa top demais."
James Gunn is a legend at directing.
This movie is perfection!
I really loved every point of the movie. Until the end. It's a shame it went by so quickly because the movie was so good. Even Youndu had a role.
"So far the Mulitverse saga has been pretty disappointing, but GOTG 3 stands out as a diamond in the rough. It has all the humor and spirit as the first two, with a note of melancholy that adds another layer of depth. I highly recommend this, I laughed, gasped, and cried through the whole thing."
A masterpiece to watch after some quantumania bullshit (late review)
It's sad an happy at the same time
"This is how cinema should be done‚Äîgoing to the movies with family, a girlfriend, or friends, and watching a great film that has it all: adventure, action, emotional moments, values. This trilogy has earned a special place in our hearts with its sense of humor, amazing characters, and the incredible friendships of the Guardians of the Galaxy. To top it all off with this beautiful song, it‚Äôs truly memorable. Thank you, Marvel, and everyone who made this trilogy possible, and thank you to all the actors who brought these wonderful characters to life. You will always be our beloved Guardians of the Galaxy!"
"While competently put together, this emotionally manipulative film is akin to watching a video of puppies being kicked for over two hours, set to a rock soundtrack"
"Amazing movie, with great story telling and a few tugs on the heart strings. We'll done Marvel!"
"While i enjoyed the first two movies more, this definitely was very enjoyable and rounded off the trilogy very nicely."
Rocket's backstory was really lovely.
"My review to this movie is late, but I did watch it in theaters. Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 was emotional, comedic and visually spectacular, and a perfect ending to the beloved Guardians of the Galaxy films."
"This feels like the perfect blend of a galactic jam session and a wild therapy group. Imagine diving into a cosmic kaleidoscope where every twist feels like a warm hug from a raccoon with boundary issues, and Rocket's trauma is unpacked like a suitcase with a broken zipper. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster of feels‚Äîlaughing at Drax's literal jokes one minute, tearing up at Rocket's past the next. The humor hits like a Groot-powered punch, and the soundtrack? You‚Äôll wish your life had a mixtape this good. Only the Guardians could pull off this chaotic, heartfelt ride through the cosmos."
Good buy old friends
Rocket Raccoon's character and backstory gave heft to this movie where the campiness and rest of the story had worn too thin.
With how bad Marvel is doing lately this is an awesome movie
This is the best mcu movie since endgame- better than no way home and deadpool and wolverine! My favourite one in the trilogy- period.
"Que delicinha o revival com o passado sofrido e tristonho do Rocket bebe‚Ä¶ Ador√°vel ambienta√ß√£o e figurino ao entrarem em Orgosc√≥pio, muito anos 90, uniformizados no remetem aos Power Rangers... Os di√°logos s√£o muito bons, cada ironia e humor √°cido ador√°vel, tudo muito bem desenvolvido, a Marvel entrega tudo em termos de super-her√≥is, f√°cil se apaixonar, at√© mesmo os que n√£o s√£o f√£s de HQ, se encantam, como eu‚Ä¶ O Groot cresceu, que pena, Mantis e Drax os meus preferidos nesse‚Ä¶ Excelente...."
"Very weird and mid , nowhere near the first or second ‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt waste your time"
"By far, the best Marvel movie since No Way Home."
Le dieron un buen final al los Guardianes de la Galaxia
"Not really my cup of tea but some cool alien cgi characters. Other people will like it more than me, but I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bad movie like Mario Bros"
The best one I really like it
"Meio meh man√©, sem hist√≥ria completa essa poha a√≠, tudo desorganizado"
"This movie was very heartfelt. It was an amazing movie, but it scared the hell out of my 6 year old cousin. I know this seems intense, but in my opinion should‚Äôve been rated R, because the animal torture is very frightening and intense. It very thrilling, and even though this movie took a darker turn than the previous ones, glad Gunn kept it hilarious."
I loved it! Definitely made everyone cry and laugh.
"Has to be one of my favorite Marvel movies thus far. Laugh, cry and enjoy the action. Well done movie."
Not a big fan of the super hero movies but all three Guardians movies are the right mix of action and humour.
"This may not be for everyone as it‚Äôs alittle hard to watch rockets back story ( wife was in tears) but this was the best instalment so far. The soundtrack is great, the story is solid and there‚Äôs just the right amount of comedy in this with serious scenes when needed."
"A very wholesome movie, did a good job making it emotional and all."
"It is a good movie, but there are some elements of violence and animal cruelty in it, which is disturbing."
Love this series so much I bought the 4K discs. I‚Äôm not a Marvel fan either but for some reason I get into the guardians. Maybe it‚Äôs partly the soundtrack - and the actors are good throughout the swries I don‚Äôt think there are any sub-par performances in this third entry and I LOVE Cosmo
"Great film all around with an adequate amount of humor while also incorporating a meaningful plot. Seemed to get a tad off track while attempting to save one of their own, however it still managed to make the viewer engage in the rest."
This was so good but it made me very emotional. I was upset through most of it but I still loved every bit of it.
"They know the formula, kick names, take ass, guardians of the galaxy never fails."
I went for a Phase 4 & Quantumania pallete cleanser. But came out with a Sob Fest üò≠
"Best of the trilogy. Every character arc is ended perfectly, and it‚Äôs hilarious and heart breaking in all the right ways. Definitely a triumph, don‚Äôt let the Marvel burn out keep you from this one, make an exception, you‚Äôll be happy."
"It's definitely a good movie that tells a lot of stories, but it's possible that I saw the first two parts a long time ago, and I liked the third part the least. If you want to watch a movie for the evening and get a lot of pleasant emotions, you can watch one hundred percent"
"Great direction for the story, I am a marvel fan, a much darker tone and more serious way to end the trilogy, great film overall."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is where the Marvel Cinematic Universe ends. There's no way any of the remaining characters are going to be as beloved as these misfits."
"Bad, worse. This movie is a waste of time. Marvel sucks after endgame."
"What can I say, I'm a fan of GOTG franchise. This one is just as good as the others I think."
I cried in this movie and that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs good. I cared about Rocket‚Äôs character throughout the whole film. And the guardians now realized about their own propose in life. And it felt me! ü•π
Special. Makes me feel grateful for family and friends.
"I mean, talk about creative vision, films with dedicated creatives usually are predisposed to not go wrong!"
"Han pasado 5 d√≠as desde que la mir√© por primera vez, y simplemente no puedo dejar de pensar en ella. Con pel√≠culas como No Way Home y Endgame, la emoci√≥n me duro si acaso dos dias, pero Guardianes de la Galaxia Vol. 3, me gener√≥ algo que han sido contadas las veces que me ha pasado y que no tengo palabras de como explicarlo."
""
"Esta pel√≠culas, es t√°n humana, que hace parecer a The Avengers como personas neutras y fr√≠as. Algo que hemos remarcado √∫ltimamente como algo positivo en las peliculas de Marvel, es el desarrollo que le dan a sus protagonistas, casos como Peter Parker y Shuri, pero el hecho de que en esta pelicula desarrollen a cada uno de los personajes, que logren aportar mucho, que cada uno de ellos destaque y, aun asi, que todo se siente totalmente organico y conectado (no como el Vol. 2)."

"Siempre sentiamos un rencor hacia James Gunn por ridiculizar a Drax, y aqu√≠, con una analog√≠a que facilmente puede llegar hasta en situaciones entre familia y/o amigos, que no es algo malo que Drax sea estupido, eso no lo hace una carga. Asi que todos seamos estupidos para poder bailar."

"Por esta ocasi√≥n, mi coraz√≥n acaba de tomar la decisi√≥n de que est√°, es la mejor pel√≠cula del Universo Cinematogr√°fico de Marvel."
"I loved the movie. I cried so much. But the problem was Adam Warlock, he's useless"
"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was a brilliant finale to a brilliant series, having every quality a brilliant movie should have. Rocket's backstory nearly put me to tears. If you haven't yet seen this masterpiece, what are you waiting for? Go watch it!"
Love this movie! I love the story
Enjoyable characters as usual.  Good to see one revolved around Rocket.
Simplesmente o melhor filme do UCM. CINEMA!
I loved this movie so much. Late to reviewing...
"Good story, great soundtrack, a bit let down that several characters aren't given much to do at all. Movie as a whole doesn't do much to push the MCU forward but satisfied Gamora got a happy ending."
"Definitely not as fun as the first movie, but it has more emotional connection to the characters now. It was hard watching at times with animal cruelty and torture being a strong theme of the film. I wait a few days to review so I can see if I'm still thinking it over as the days progress and while its not got the complexity of some that make me  run through the plot for days on end,I definitely had a few moments where I smiled when thinking about the Florence&the machine song scene at the end which I really enjoyed"
"This is by far, one of the best MCU movies since endgame. I went to see it in theaters and was so into its story line."
Garbage movie waste of time
"Possibly the best Marvel film... ever. James Gunn, Marvel is going to miss you. Personally, I love the shift from Peter to Rocket. No other Marvel film has made me cry more than this."
"This movie is so cute and silly. As we have seen from prior Guardians films, the family of misfits is truly one of the best bonds in the universe. This movie takes you above and beyond what you think you know and does it all on the soundtracks people used to listen to through their Walkman."
"Amazing, as predicted. All of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are so good, and this one did not disappoint. It is super fun and action-packed, but I am scared that this might be the last good marvel movie."
"I was afraid of what Disney was going to do with Guardians of the Galaxy. But surprisingly, they did nothing. James Gunn with creative freedom is incredible. The best closure for one of the best Marvel trilogies. Highly recommended."
Thought it was a terrific final chapter to the Guardians franchise. Loved the fact that it was pretty much a Rocket-centric story. Lots of high paced action and the typical Guardians humor.
The last great MCU film! Farewell
"Loved it!! Fantastic effects, wonderful playlist, and incredibly moving scenes."
JUST WATCH IT IT'S AMAZING! JAMES GUNN IS A GOAT!!!
"Guardians 3 is the perfect conclusion to the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. The trilogy had a strong start with the first movie, a shaky continuation with 2, and an amazing grand finale with 3. Guardians 3 has cemented itself as both an amazing movie, as well as one of my personal favorite movies. What Guardians 2 failed to do regarding an emotional impact, this movie more than makes up for. This movie has the power to make you rethink how you view things in life. When you think you know your closest friends, there is a story you don't know, and this concept is exemplified for more than one character. Both Drax and Rocket have fantastic moments demonstrating they're more than what they may seem. Originally Nebula was one of my least favorite characters in all of the MCU. I found her abrasive, arrogant, and frustrating. Even understanding her past, I still could not get behind her as a character. This of course changed over time, and Guardians 3 took her from being a character I was simply alright with to being one of my favorites. The growth she shows from the original Guardians to Guardians 3 feels natural and well earned. Peter has his own story regarding Gamora and a fantastic ending that reminds me that sometimes things don't work out, but what matters is enjoying the fun times while we have them. Every character gets their chance to shine. There are good laughs, and most likely a good cry. Without a doubt Guardians of the Galaxy 3 had crowned itself as the magnum opus of the Guardians cinematic trilogy, and it is more than worth the watch. There are very few ""lows"" of the movie, and very many highs. The lows are only a matter of opinion as well, there are no glaring issues with the film as a whole, only things some people might not enjoy for their own reasons. It is not inherently flawed, but instead inherently beautiful. This films impact was well earned and heightened by its predecessors. I have no real complaints about this movie, and I hope one day the MCU can reach this level of quality again."
"Finally, it reached the last part of this trilogy, which was executed excellently and stood out as unique. I went to the cinema without any expectations, as a Marvel fan and after the biggest thing that Marvel has done other movies and series that come out have decreased quality, losing excitement and interest.However, after watching this movie is truly a masterpiece, It bids farewell to every character, including James Gunn (writer/director) who will now go control a DC Universe, It is heartwarming, concluding with the warmth of this family."

"""In this third movie, it will be different from the previous films and other movies in that there will be no new Easter eggs or new connections in the universe. This time, it serves as a summary for each character, addressing various remaining issues. The main protagonist is Rocket Raccoon, and we will finally get answers to questions about Rocket's origins, background, and why he is highly intelligent and interested in technology and mechanics. The exploration of Rocket's origins leads to the main problem, 'The High Evolutionary.' He is a character who worships modification and is a leader with a penchant for altering living things to be intelligent, similar to humans. Personally, I find this character intriguing as an antagonist who appears rational and has a high level of psychological complexity. In this film, the script and performances are impressive when compared to previous villains. An essential part is the chance to see Rocket's various species of friends and their unique qualities. The diverse and perfect portrayal of these characters adds a memorable touch. Additionally, the creativity in action scenes is outstanding, creating several memorable moments."""
""
"Another factor that impressed me was the various visuals that were composed quite well and the visual effects CGI were smooth throughout the story, which is something that fans Many people complain because lately, the quality of every visual has dropped, but this time we have to give the credit to director who delivering a polished and well-executed visual spectacle. The action scenes are very satisfying. Known as the guardian of the galaxy, what is indispensable and very unique is the soundtrack. Still choosing songs from the 80's, and 90's to use, which can be said to be extremely good, choosing songs with skill and conveying emotion in the scene. That or that character was very good and this movie made those songs popular again and are the favorites of many viewers who will definitely go back and listen again."
""
"For me ""Guardian of the Galaxy Vol.3"" is one of the best entries Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avenger Endgame"". Due to the more chaotic and dramatic of story that twice from last two films in this trilogy, It gives a complete summary of every story and includes characters that make you miss the actors who have great chemistry together Another thing that is indispensable, Rocket will be in the hearts of every audience, including myself, and I personally consider him to be the most prominent character in Marvel, including this team, and through this plot it becomes an advantage of this movie, everyone who hasn't seen parts 1 and 2 before they will definitely understand the entire movie because they are movies that end in it."
"I loved everything about this movie. This was a perfect example of ending something when it should be. This doesn't mean I'm not sad about them disbanding, but I still think the serious tone and separation was necessary. Hope to see them back in Secret Wars or the Kang Dynasty"
Makes you say marvel is back! But it won't last long awesome movie
"Such a great watch. The comedy, the story, the raw emotional damage is just perfect. i also really liked the Rocket flashback scenes and think they are probably one of the best parts of the whole movie. I also really liked the villain, he was just kind of an asshole but he was genuinely the best marvel villain of 2023. Go watch this movie right now"
√ìtimo filme! Recomendo demais assistir esse filme.
"Isso sim √© cinema, √© um filme e filme de super-her√≥i perfeito."
At√© hoje impressionado como esse filme foi bom!
Amazing send off to the guardians
"James Gunn closes his guardians trilogy strong with the third installment focusing on rocket raccoon and his past. This movie closes all the guardians stories out beautifully. The standouts being star lord and rocket. This movie focusing on rockets story makes this an emotional ride. The movie while being very emotional, is also filled with gut busting moments that will have you laughing out loud. The action is great, the visuals are sensational, and of course the soundtrack is amazing. Once again, an amazing end to the trilogy of films."
"On about the same level as Vol. 2, if not a little better."
"What can I say, James Gunn and this cast of top notch cast of actresses and actors has done it again.  Concluding the story of the Guardians has been a tear perking, heart pounding, laugh enducing thrill ride from start to finish.  The worse part of this movie is saying goodbye to the family that we are know a part of!!"
Worth the watch if you saw previous movies of marvel aswell as previous volumes of Guardians of the galaxy
"Perfect ending to the trilogy, great action & cgi, good emotional connection to the cast and events during the film & all finished off with a perfect ending."
Such an ideal way to deliver a message
with the marvel movies.
"The last Guardians movie and it ended with a bang, where every other movie from Marvel tried to force humour into characters not built for it."
""
"James Gunn shows us what happens when you take these silly on paper characters and put them through the ringer. The new characters are great and feel right at home in the movie, the visuals remain superb and it's existing cast offer good performances."
""
"Especially with Bradley Cooper, Chris Pratt and Karen Gillian. Who have done well in the past movies but stood out here. It's an emotional roller coaster that feels like it nails the mood. Its moments feel quite forced but don't take away from the movie."
""
Overall its a bitter sweet departure from one of my favourite summer blockbuster trilogies. A good trilogy of movies.
The best movie of phase 5 but the worst starring the Guardians of the Galaxy.
"While Vol 2 wasn't terrible, it was a downgrade from the first. Vol 3 can't quite get us back to that height but gets us closer. Lots of heart but just needs tightened a bit more."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an utter disappointment, marking a new low for Marvel. From the atrocious costumes that barely resemble the beloved characters to the complete lack of continuity with previous films, it's evident that the essence of Marvel died with its creator. Instead of a coherent storyline, viewers are subjected to a disjointed mess that feels more akin to watching Teletubbies than a superhero blockbuster. Despite attempting humor, the jokes fall flat, lacking the wit and charm of earlier Marvel films. Gone are the moral principles and heartwarming moments that defined the franchise, replaced by gratuitous violence and a haphazard plot. It's as if the filmmakers prioritized creating bizarre set pieces over crafting a cohesive narrative. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 abandons the themes of family, support, and adventure that once made the series great, opting instead for a chaotic blend of juvenile humor and uninspired action sequences. This film is a disgrace to its predecessors, and children should be shielded from its lackluster attempts at entertainment. Marvel's once-classy humor and heartwarming moments have been replaced by a mishmash of Spy Kids and Teletubbies, leaving audiences with a sour taste and a longing for the glory days of the MCU."
Amazing movies with great story's
This is the best Guardians of the Galaxy movie by far there is not doubt in my mind... and I liked the other 2 installments
"Another Guardians of the Galaxy movie. They're honestly so lame, I don't know how anyone cares about these characters."
It's a masterpiece ... We want more üí™ü§†
"Incr√≠vel, James Gun √© um g√™nio, tu ri chora, te preocupa, emociona."
No explanation. I just found the dream of my life in it.
Can't believe they won't make more of these!
Top 50 movie as of 2024
They seem to not be able to mess these up at all.
"A more serious and dark tone than the others, but is still a fun, action-packed adventure and fitting send-off to the lovable Guardians of the Galaxy."
"The best film of the year. I just loved it so much. James Gunn is one of my favourite Directors and the magic he brings to any film is amazing, and this epic finale to his Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy... my god if it isn't perfect! The emotions I felt during this film are not unlike when saying goodbye to an old friend, and it shows how good Gunn is at this. Rocket Raccoon is given a fantastic arc and Star Lord gets, maybe not the happy ending we wanted, but he definitely deserved something like this. Even Gamora's ending, whilst maybe not going the way it should've went (but that wasn't Gunn's fault that was if anything Infinity War's fault), was still so emotional and just worked. Thank you James Gunn. You have given us the perfect ending you could for these characters. I cannot wait to see what he does with Superman and the rest of DC."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic end to the Guardians trilogy while also the perfect start to something new if someone wishes to take it there in the future. The story of these movies has always had heart to them, and this one is no different. Every character in this film has a big emotional moment for themselves that has been building up from the first film. The cast is as charming and emotional as ever, especially Bradley Cooper, who was great in this journey as Rocket Raccoon. One favorite of mine from this film is Will Poulter, who perfectly plays a dumb kid in an adult super-powered body very well and has some great comedic delivery when needed. Chukwudi Iwuji also does very well, taking what may usually be seen as a stereotypical bad guy and giving him a bit of an edge to make the character more comfortable and fun to digest than past MCU villains. As usual with these films, the music choices are elite and tell the story on their own! The film's visuals, from the crazy visual effects of space and CGI creatures to the more practical makeup and animal suits, to the shots, it all works so well. The comedy, more or less, is very well-timed. One issue with the film is that it often cuts between moments of true heart to more typical superhero action-type moments which, although expected, does slow down the pace, especially when all we want is to get back to the heart. Overall, if you enjoyed the first two films, you will probably enjoy this one if you don't mind a bit of a darker tone. If you didn't enjoy the first two, perhaps the small change in tone will make the film work for you. Either way, Guardians 3 is a great addition to the superhero genre in general, and Marvel is going to miss James Gunn."
"Epic, emotional and a very satisfying conclusion!!!"
Awesome and exciting. Well done Marvel!
"This movie was so very disappointing, I wish they would delete it and start over. I generally don't watch anything Marvel, but I love sci-fi and I was completely obsessed with the first two GOTG. This was a shameful mess, the plot was disjointed, the acting was phoned-in - it was like everyone involved just gave up and didn't care. Everything that charmed me about the first two movies - the jokes, the awesome music, the character interplay, just made me sad. Everything was forced, unfunny, uninteresting.  I wish they never made it at all."
"Excellent movie, in line with the first 2 episodes. Great mix of action, fun, emotional moments and characters development. I'm not a big fan of the Marvel universe but this franchise is great regardless. Hope this is not the end‚Ä¶"
Great movie to finish off the trilogy.
"Fue el cierre perfecto de esta trilog√≠a, cada personaje encuentra su camino y se logra apreciar el desarrollo en cada uno de ellos."
"El hacer que la trama gire en torno a Rocket y mostrarnos m√°s de su historia es un gran acierto porque resuelve muchas inc√≥gnitas del porqu√© de su car√°cter. Adem√°s, es muy emotiva."
"Me agrada que fuercen la relaci√≥n entre Gamora y Peter, es lo m√°s sensato."
"Por √∫ltimo, el villano fue excelentemente interpretado."
""
Se extra√±ar√° este equipo de inadaptados.
"Loved this movie.  Great characters, story and action.  Also very funny.  I might watch it again sometime."
"Too much emphasis on the special effects.  Overall slow pace, shallow plot."
I am permanently heartbroken by a selfish racoon with a gun capable of mass destruction who has been to over 20 prisons and escaped each time. I can't believe that works.
Incredible movie and story that is leagues better than anything we've seen from Marvel over the last couple years. I would've like to see more about Drax as his comic origin was more interesting but overall this movie was very pleasant and one of my favorites for 2023.
"This was the perfect way to end THIS incarnation of the Guardians and subsequently, James Gunn's run as a director for Marvel. This movie was amazing. It was packed full of action, Gunn's brand of humor and highly emotional moments. Addressing a couple of complaints I read ahead of the movie, the dynamic between the villain, The High Evolutionary, and Rocket was the life of the movie. And seriously, the High Evolutionary is probably one of the strongest villains Marvel has ever put out. Also, this movie is not a tragedy. This is actually a movie of redemption and triumph and most importantly, one of mending. The whole crux of this movie is finding one's purpose again after it's been lost."
"This movie was the most emotionally taxing Guardians movie to date but was also a great sendoff story for the friends we've come to know. This Movie hit all the marks from storyline, to cast, to visual effects this movie did not miss! and to no surprise at all it also had an amazing soundtrack. This movie will for sure go down as one of the marvel greats."
In an age where marvel is awful this movie hit. I don't know what it was but this movie was amazing.
"Es muy buena, los gr√°ficos y animaciones me encantaron gracias Marvel por seguir realizando muy buenas pel√≠culas"
"As beautiful as it is brutal. Comedic, melodic, chaotic, and electric. Of all the serial entries to various heroes, who knew The Guardians of the Galaxy would come out as one of the best and most cohesive? If you're a fan of the series, this is a much watch."
"I think this was one of my top faves of the MCU. Loved the mix of action and sentiment behind this movie, especially uncovering Rockets past that I didn't know I needed. I also loved the ending. Very fitting. Mantis finally gets her amazing badass moment. She shines :)"
I saw this on release and I have got to say this is my favorite guardians film
"Deserves a lot of credit for centering the story on a CGI character. The subject matter is very serious and even difficult to watch at times. As a result, most of the jokes feel forced as they don't feel organic to the plotline. There is also a cluttered element to the story simply due to so many characters getting their moment and resolution. However, in the midst of it all the film finds its' strength in establishing an inner connection with the audience without becoming overly sappy. Not the easiest watch, but an emotional one that pays off in both a cinematic and personal way."
"When I think of Guardians of the Galaxy, I think of an incredible soundtrack and lots of fun. This third film was missing that. It was depressing and the soundtrack fit the mood. (50%)"
"Thank you, James Gunn, for doing justice to GOTG. The only movie since Spiderman: No Way Home that begins in the pantheon of excellence in the MCU."
I really liked it.  It was funny and had some great action.  It loses points on how nicely packaged the ending was and also I felt Gamora's arch was dumb.
Alright 3rd entry. Still enjoyed the first GofG more.
"Cried three times, laughed even more. Rocket, the unsung hero of this trilogy, ties beautifully together the story of the Guardians. When they created the first movie, I'm certain they had no idea how the story would come to an end. But it could not have ended more poignantly and on a more deserving character. The whole franchise is the story of Rocket the Raccoon. Also, great music and I appreciate how they handled the romance of Quill and Gamora. A very refreshing take."
An emotional final installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies that stands out as one of the better MCU films since 'Endgame'. Held together mainly by the familiar characters we have come to know over the last 9 years.
"I agree with the NPR movie reviewer, a mawkish mixtape. The first two Guardians movies were a real real hit with me. This one was a definite miss. I never thought I'd see myself say good riddance. Both the actors and the characters they played were ill-used by both the writers, director and scene designers. Yuck!"
"An absolute tearjerker of a movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 will leave you satisfied on the smaller scale of this ragtag group of heroes, as well as pleased will the overall storylines of the MCU as a whole. A must watch IMHO, and the movie to cement this trilogy as one of, if not the greatest, trilogies of all time."
"The worst of the guardians of the galaxy movies,"
"Complete letdown, I could've gone without watching any of it"
"This is a feel good movie which gives us hope that the Legendary Star-Lord isn't gone forever. The backstory of Rocket is disturbing, but does explain his rage and anger. I've enjoyed GOTG, while the other Marvel movies have become old and stale. Gamora plays well, and Quill's love loss is humorous and believable.  You really wish for Gamora to come back. It leaves us disappointed and wondering why can't she love her friends again after risking her life for them.  This is a definite watch!"
"I liked the plot, Made me cry so minus points. I'm mentally wrong I don't cry when humans die but animals hits different."
"La mejor  pel√≠cula basada en c√≥mics del 2023 en mi opini√≥n. Una vez m√°s James gun nos sorprende con una buena pel√≠cula de s√∫per h√©roes. Esta pel√≠cula lo tiene de todo.. Comedia bien ejecutada, buenas escenas de acci√≥n, buen desarrollo de personajes.. Etc"
This movies was boring and too long. The story had too much uninteresting and unnecessary dialogue that I fell asleep multiple times. Rockets story is not something I wanted. We needed the Guardians for a bigger issue in the galaxy. Not a backstory. The action scenes were extremely far apart and never lasted long enough to keep the entertainment going. The costume designs and overall scenery for the antagonist colony was blah and makes you cringe.
"Hot flaming garbage. It is so chalked full of bathos that it gets old so fast. Not funny, plot is fine at best. It ruins any moments of cool action or sincerity with stupid jokes. It sets it self up as such a joke that for the big emotional moment at the end I just expected people to get heart attacks from surprise."
Just what all the fans wanted and needed! Roller coaster of emotions with the perfect ending....or will the Guardians be back....
"Though uneven, it was a fitting end to the trilogy that had the right amount of pathos, and also got real dark at times."
"perfeitoooo. amei, melhor filme"
This movie has the heart of the good old Marvel movie.
The most personal and emotionally driven Marvel movie in years. This is what Marvel needs.
"James Gunn managed to do the impossible and make a guardians film better than the first. This movie expands and delivers on everything you want it to; humor, drama, emotion, and spectacular performances from the cast, but especially Bradley Cooper and Chukwudi Iwuji. The balance between drama and humor is almost perfect. The pacing was near pitch perfect. The action was dialed up to 11 compared to the first 2 and Gunn was allowed to go darker and more violent than some audiences may expect. With this film it solidifies the guardians trilogy as the best in the MCU and maybe the best superhero trilogy of all time."
"üáÆüáπ Un film fantastico realizzato perfettamente e che chiude un cerchio durato ben 9 anni che si dimostra stupendo. Guardiani della Galassia Vol.3 √® realizzato splendidamente da James Gunn che dopo aver creato le due meraviglie dei primi due capitoli, sforna un altro CAPOLAVORO che si porta dietro tutti i pregi dei suoi personaggi. Caratterizzazioni perfette, colonna sonora fantasmagorica, fotografia e regia degni di premi, insomma una bellissima chiusura che ti travolge dalle emozioni. Questo √® un film che va vissuto dall'inizio alla fine, lasciandoti trasportare dalla storia, la quale alterna momenti tristi a momenti esilaranti e comici, ti porta a una sensazione fantastica che varia da spettatore a spettatore e rende questo finale perfetto. Non va visto come un semplice cinecomic, poich√© affronta tematiche importanti che vengono trattate benissimo dal registra. Le performance degli attori sono bellissime, poich√© si percepisce dallo schermo che sarebbe stata una chiusura sentita anche dalla crew, e tutte le loro emozioni vengono trasferite nel film. Senza dubbio si posiziona nella top 3 dei migliori film MCU, per la sua completezza e la sua realizzazione, la quale √® veramente riuscita splendidamente. Gunn √® riuscito a superarsi nel modo di scrivere poich√©, insieme a tutto il cast √® riuscito a descrivere un viaggio intergalattico nel corso di questi anni, dove mai nessuno si sarebbe aspettato un finale cos√¨ bello, ci troviamo a dei livelli altissimi di cinema. Insomma, un film fantastico, scritto da un regista fantastico, che porta a termine la miglior trilogia, di maggior successo di tutti i cinecomic, in una maniera emozionante che ti lascia di stucco e ti fa piangere come un bambino!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-üá¨üáß A fantastic film made perfectly and that closes a circle that lasted 9 years that proves to be wonderful. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is beautifully crafted by James Gunn who after creating the two wonders of the first two chapters, churns out another MASTERPIECE that carries with him all the merits of his characters. Perfect characterizations, phantasmagorical soundtrack, photography and direction worthy of awards, in short, a beautiful closure that overwhelms you with emotions. This is a film that must be lived from beginning to end, letting you be carried away by the story, which alternates sad moments with hilarious and comic moments, brings you to a fantastic feeling that varies from viewer to viewer and makes this ending perfect. It should not be seen as a simple cinecomic, as it deals with important issues that are treated very well by the recording. The performances of the actors are beautiful, as it is perceived from the screen that it would have been a closure felt even by the crew, and all their emotions are transferred to the film. Without a doubt it ranks in the top 3 of the best MCU movies, for its completeness and its realization, which has truly succeeded beautifully. Gunn managed to surpass himself in the way of writing because, together with all the cast, he managed to describe an intergalactic journey over the course of these years, where no one would ever have expected such a beautiful ending, we are at the highest levels of cinema. In short, a fantastic film, written by a fantastic director, which completes the best trilogy, the most successful of all cinecomics, in an exciting way that leaves you stunned and makes you cry like a child!"
i love rocket lore
i have soft spot for racoons now
Perfect end to the trilogy.
"The best sci fi movie i have ever seen, beat even all star wars  and star treks movies."
"The film made me rediscover my emotional side, as this film brings a mixture of feelings.  Simply sensational. The visual setting, story and soundtracks are very good, it's no wonder that the sequel is known for having better background music."
This movie gave me everything.
""
It made me laugh. It made me awe. It made me cry. It made me hate and it made me have hope for the MCU's future.
""
Rocket was the standout with the movie at its best with every scene with the raccoon.
""
The soundtrack had me headbanging and tear-up and the ending made my heart melt with joy.
""
James Gunn has always been my favorite writer/director. And this movie only assured me in my taste.
a good ending to a beautiful trilogy
"Just awesomely entertaining. I really enjoyed every minute of this movie. However it sucks there won't be a #4, at least not with all the same cast. I'm grateful for the movies they made and look forward to seeing some characters pop up in other Marvel movies. Not only a must see movie but may be a must own video series."
"Esto es exactamente lo que espero cuando me siento a ver una pel√≠cula de Marvel y de superh√©roes en general. Una excelente combinaci√≥n entre accion, humor, ciencia ficci√≥n, buen ritmo, buena historia, momentos emotivos, etc etc. Ninguna de las 3 guardianes de la galaxia fallaron con mis expectativas, excepciones as√≠ son las que mantienen vivo a este universo."
One of The best MCU Movies that doesn't feel like One
"This movie has a lot of heart. While I don't think it's equally impactful for someone unfamiliar with the GotG universe, the more serious and somewhat mature approach to the characters and situations makes it impossible for me not to love it. It feels like genuine growth without losing the fun aspect that characterizes these films."
"OMG! I never thought I slag a Guardian's movie, but I had to turn it off about 2/3 of the way through. Worst of all are many arguments and yelling. Gamora screams right into Starlord's face several times. It must be addictive because Mantis screams at Drax, and Nebula screams at everybody. - including sister Gamora."
""
"Then there was the really, really poor set design for the ""organic"" world. (whatever it's called) The scenes with the intestinal troopers wrapped in pink gut costumes, with human heads? Most of the CG was inadequate. Come on! With a $200 million, or whatever, budget, how did Gunn's usually meticulous script and direction slide through? As I watched the beginning, I kept waiting for the story to take hold, but it never became a good movie. Was there no one who dared to say this movie was a jumbled mess? There are too many other things I couldn't stand."
"I loved G of G's first 2 films, but this did not come close to being equal."
was niice watched it with my gf at home so sweet: the dog scene: DONT CALL YOUR DOG A BAD DOG its very mean!!
"Expected more.  First two were entertaining and interesting with great music.  This one was a pale image and wanna be, forced sequel.  The characters were still very good but the story just dragged on and on.  It had disjointed development, the battle scenes were too long, there were way too many made up ""creatures.""  And the so-called music really stunk.  It was hard to listen to it.  Sorry to be harsh but that is my opinion due to my disappointment and boredom."
"The Guardians will always shot for the stars, like a Rocket (Raccoon)."
Very sweet---I cried several times and honestly the ending to this just tied the whole story together so nicely.
"For those concerned as to the MCU's quality post-Endgame, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is proof that you do not need to worry."
I should not be crying this hard over fake CGI animals.
A worthy ending for a worthy movie.
"One of the best marvel movies, the cast and villain are excellent. A big movie experience with excellent soundtrack."
"You're going to tear up a time or two as you see what happens when each individual Guardian decides to see what's best for them in life. You see Rockets back story, MCU version as it's altered from the comics. It's still a Guardians movie, so they've kept the humor, but there's still sizable stakes which have been missing from other recent Marvel movies."
"Very emotional, fun, excellent finish to a trilogy. It has sad moments but it won't break your heart. Plot is pretty solid, pacing is top tier, humor and action were also top tier. Top tier Marvel."
"The movie did phenomenal with the backstory on Rocket - devastating, but that's exactly what these movies need is emotions involved. For the final installment it sure didn't feel like the end - the movie made it feel as if there are more movies to come in the future."
"O melhor filme da Marvel desde da Pandemia,a Com√©dia t√° muito boa,os personagens continuam perfeitos,o vil√£o √© muito bom √© o melhor filme de super her√≥i do ano"
The movie ended the trilogy better than anyone thought it could.
"Loved this film, I am groot"
One of the very few marvel movies lately that was not awful.  Not the best of the series but fun
Best film seen in years!
"The mowie was awesome. James Gunn was awesome. When I saw first Guardians of the galaxy, I found my marvel love. Now, when marvel is not like before Guardians everything saved."
"Tying up 10 years of story, Guardians 3 delivers an epic and moving finale. One of the highlights of the MCU."
This is the best Trilogy in the MCU what a great ending to the og Guardians.
A fantastic end to the trilogy.
""
It's also makes me want to see more of the Characters
"The cinematic experience presented by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 was a rich tapestry of elements, seamlessly weaving together humor, music, emotion, and introspection. This synthesis elicited a diverse spectrum of emotions, ranging from laughter and melodic engagement to moments that brought tears and prompted applause. The film's profound impact lay in its capacity to provoke existential contemplation, compelling the audience to reflect on their own existence."
"The choreography of the fight sequences was a compelling fusion of power, entertainment, and graphic precision. Marvel's prowess in delivering visceral and visually captivating moments was evident, and the film consistently maintained a high standard of action throughout."
"A notable aspect was how the narrative transcended the boundaries of conventional entertainment. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 offered a deeply touching story that resonated on an emotional level, evoking genuine tears. The stakes were deftly heightened, creating a suspenseful atmosphere that had viewers perched on the edge of their seats, fully immersed in the unfolding drama. No agenda or awkward nonsense of politics."
""
"In essence, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 stands as a testament to Marvel's mastery in crafting narratives that surpass the superficial, leaving an enduring impact on the audience. This commendable approach, marked by powerful storytelling, high-stakes drama, and visually stunning sequences, suggests a trajectory worth continuing in future endeavors, perhaps even in highly anticipated projects like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 4."
"I wasn't expecting to cry on rewatch, but I couldn't help it with this film. I'm on a journey to watch all of the 2024 Oscar nominees, and next up is a rewatch of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, my favorite comic book movie of the year, a fantastic and heartfelt conclusion to a trilogy, and the best MCU film since Avengers: Endgame. This film does an amazing job at expanding the characters, especially Rocket who is definitely the highlight of this film for me, and for most people. It's so heartbreaking, yet interesting to learn about his origins of how he became who he is now, and it makes him so much more interesting and have so much more importance than he ever did before. Despite being the most emotional Guardians' film, I also think that this is the funniest, as I think it's humor works so well, particularly Drax and Mantis, who are certainly at their best in this film. James Gunn was already one of the best CBM directors, but this film just made me respect him so much more, which excites me for his Superman movie and the rest of the DCU. You can tell how much he cares about these characters, with how much he puts into them here. When I saw this in theatres back in May, I was slightly disappointed when I left the cinema, which is why before rewatch my rating for this film was a 4 1/2 star instead of the 5-star it is now. I've come to love this film so much more over time, and appreciate everything it did. I truly don't believe that I, or anyone else for that matter could've come up with a better finale and sendoff to these characters besides James Gunn. There was one line said by rocket in the last 15-20 minutes that I thought was quite bad, but besides that one small detail, I think this film is as good as it could possibly be, making it one of my favorites of 2023."
""
"Original Review: (4¬Ω/5 Stars) A satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of fun and laughs, while also having a much darker tone than the other films. At least right now, this is my favorite of the Guardians movies, as it easily has the best plot, the best villain, and is extremely emotional, and will certainly bring tears to your eyes. A near-perfect sendoff to the Guardians."
The third movie of the Guardians - really was amazing.
Great fun movie for a relaxed evening with your feet up - a bit of silliness to escape the everyday for a couple of hours.  Very well executed.
I had to watch it twice in theaters regardless of the tear jerking moments that leave you cry laughing at the end. Phenomenal film that's just good for the soul.
"The movie felt rushed and paced badly. There was no intro to the movie and threw unknown characters at you so quickly it was almost overwhelming. Character design was cool but some felt excessive in ways. It was also a very mixed emotion movie where one scene is sad then 2 seconds later it's a happy high energy movie, then goes back to some sad flash back. It was an entertaining movie but also made you feel annoyed and almost confused when you watch it"
"I honestly think they couldn't have made this better! A perfect conclusion to an almost perfect trilogy! A darker, more gory movie than the other two, but still just as funny! The High Evolutionary is a great villain that you hate to the core. By the end, I started to tear up. They also made Rocket one of the best characters in the MCU and give Gamora an interesting plot line with what happened after Infinity War. 10/10!"
La mejor franquicia un buen villano Rocket tiene de origen triste todos los personajes son carism√°ticos y el humor es genial y acci√≥n es incre√≠ble es un 9.5 de 10
"Tudo que se espera de um filme da marvel, sensacional em todos os aspectos, trilha sonora e cinematogr√°fica, tudo impressiona em um final emocionante e com uma √≥tima finaliza√ß√£o do arco dos guardi√µes da gal√°xia."
Best marvel movie ever amazing
"Probably the only MCU franchise which will sustain passing time, great story, superb actors, and obviously Zoe Saldana absolutely gorgeous on top of her acting skills, even all green, that tells you something."
"Horrific in its cruelty. No comic-book movie has any business being this harrowing. The villain was much too cruel and demented. Thanos (and others) hurt people, but you didn't really experience it, like this. This movie is an absolute outlier, for its genre. I watch movies like these to forget about the level of cruelty in the world, not to have it replicated, to such an extent."
"This movie just pushed a bunch of my buttons, too effectively. The animal experimentation/ animal cruelty, the joy the animals found, in such a bleak situation, oblivious to how doomed they were. There was some bleak stuff in the previous movies, but not like this. My god."
"I enjoyed the first two of these three movies; but fuck this movie, and the people who made it."
"The caveat: I am out-of-step with the consensus, here. And I only got through about half of it."
"I was stunned, when I saw that I was only halfway through, for all it had already done to me. Not sure I could even get through the rest. This movie made me feel, for a few hours, afterwards, like I acutely understood how Friedrich Nietzsche was driven mad by witnessing cruelty to animals. Again, fuck whoever was in charge of the story, here."
Brought my love for these characters to a whole new level.
A perfect conclusion to a beloved trilogy!
"James Gunn ends the trilogy with passion, colour, and hope for his future work in the superhero genre."
The trilogy is complete. Emotion is high in this last entry as its a farewell performance. We get Rocket's origin story and Chukwudi Iwuji shines in a memorable performance as probably one of the best MCU villains so far. This turned out to be the best trilogy that the MCU has offered so far. See it!
"Best one yet. The viewer is asked some questions and will maybe end up pondering some things in the real world, but with a really great message and in a way you can enjoy this movie. I'm generally not into superhero movies but guardians is the best and in my option this was the best one yet but some considerable margin. Fantastic movie. Great storyline and one of two brilliant new characters!"
"So from the previous film, I like the schematography and CGI effects, this is much better, the music is still good and much more, the director is really creative, also the comedy of this film is a good point, and in terms of story it's good, but not special, just maybe the director wanted to change the main character from Peter Quiil to Rocket, it was quite good and not too forced, so my score is 85 out of 100, you succeeded"
"A good film, with Rocket as the most captivating character."
"Incredible movie with a very heartfelt story! Definetly one of the best MCU movies, and it's great to see how great Marvel can go to! It's just hard to see how good this is compared to other and more recent MCU movies. Loves the movie, and have almost no gripes with it, just don't think it's perfect."
"Critics fail to mention the core nature of GoG vol. 3, as the deeply sickening yet necessary commentary piece that it is. Which puts the animal suffering, abuse, torture, experimentation which although takes place lightyears away in the film reminds us (of the well established inhumane and abominable practices of animal torture that exists unfettered and unchecked here on our home planet earth)."
""
"The graphic,  gut-wrenching cruelty exhibited in the film towards Rocket and friends, holds a mirror right up to the faces of movie-goers to peer into ""up close and personal"", whether we viewers want to or not. Forcing the person staring into that mirror (you and I), to confront the terrifying & unsettling reality it calls into focus."
""
"Which is the mass global suffering  of animals imparted by the brutality, violence, entitlement, greed, and abominable practices of humans."
"Which we as a SOCIETY,  have long learned to tune out. Tuned to hear nothing more than echoes of a forgotten background noise. Gog 3 takes us all by the hand and walks us out of the soundproof box, or the cave of shadows, and we become cognizant of our reality for the first time in a long time and we hear and see those sights and sounds we had droned out long ago and remain on the frequency. The door was opened by the director and producer to invite change, and hope, and an end to the suffering."
""
"The film is done so beautifully and painfully, that though we walk away from the film back to our lives, viewers are left with the permanent reminder that the veil has been lifted and removed from the facade and crumbling veneer obscuring the terror in our own world, which we are all responsible for."
""
"We have shielded ourselves from and built a society around to help us do specifically that. We leave GoG 3 knowing we have an obligation, to the animals, captive or wild, to protect them and guard against all experimentation, torture, cruelty, suffering, environmental depletion, and habitat obliteration. We can't turn our heads away anymore."
""
"An unshakeable sting of heartache and of culpability that directors & writers cleverly crafted to intentionally mark us with, swells with intensity in any lingering moments that follow viewing, in passing silences or any quiet stillness, left to ponder the intrusive device poking at your through the days after viewing. The nature of which to motivate viewers as the film creators intended so that even the least caring person is moved and stirrs in contemplation moved to demand change, and set about protecting the innocent creatures of our world- which are all living things.   The systemic and monstrous abusive relationship that exists between humans unto animals is the undeniable story that is both a timely and painful message, that all viewers must contemplate and act on for the betterment of all life human and animal near and far, always."
"With this volume being my least favorite of the 3, it had great special effects and decent comedy but with a story all over the place. I miss the days of phases 1-3 but unfortunately those days are over and it shows here. The magic just isn't there anymore."
"too many repetitive ""we are a family"" scenes. Americans really miss having a family"
"While I fondly recall the first two parts of this trilogy, this was the first time the group of cosmic guardians disappointed me. Perhaps it's because I don't navigate the Marvel universe at all and barely remember the plot of the second movie, but I have a few opinions I'd like to share."
""
"Certainly, shortening the film wouldn't hurt. Despite various action shootouts, visual effects, and explosions, it dragged on, and I found myself having the urge to skip certain parts. That's never a good sign."
""
"On the other hand, the chemistry between the main characters remained humorous and convincing, although perhaps a bit clich√©. Nevertheless, their lines still entertained me, and they are stuck in my mind to this day."
""
"Rocket's storyline stands out the most in the whole film, becoming the centre of everything. It captivated with its twisted absurdity that skillfully targeted emotions. It brought depth to the past of the beloved mysterious raccoon."
""
"My expectations were higher, impacting my final review. However, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a well-crafted film that fans of action and comedy will surely appreciate, and I, too, look forward to revisiting this group."
"Possibly the best Marvel film‚Ä¶ ever. James Gunn, you have outdone yourself, my friend."
"No, just no!"
""
The first three were great and entertaining. How anyone could say this movie was entertaining is beyond me. Maybe the didn't see the first two?
"This was a top 10 worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen. The soundtrack, which was absolutely perfect in the first two movies in the series was just dreadful in this one. Went from the 70s and 80s to I don‚Äôt even know what era. Suffice to say I don‚Äôt think I knew a single one of the songs. The storyline was dark and depressing and definitely not one for kids. I loved the first one, really liked the second one, and wished I‚Äôd never watched the third one."
IT KINDA MEH MOMMY.(Jahda majja nai ayaa)
"Not gonna lie, this film is a narrative mess. However, it's great in every other area, super fun, absolutely well worth a watch, and ties things up nicely at the end. Guardians always was the best of the MCU. Star-Lord may return, but for me this is satisfying exit point for the Disney Marvel franchise."
It was hilarious fun and a emotional Rollercoaster I love that about the movie. Im also glad that we got Rocket's backstory. I also really loved meeting Cosmos the space dog. But I didn't really feel the ending maybe if I was a child but not as a 20 year old. I don't want this to sound like I hated the ending because I didn't. I also didn't understand what Comose role was in the movie. But other then those 2 downfalls. I loved it a good way to end the trilogy indeed
So great compared to many superhero and other Marvel movies. Mainly focused on Rocket‚Äôs backstory
Loved this movie so much. Anyone that says this is the least of the 3 is just wrong. Watched it and had to immediately watch it again. Loved every scene and will miss these characters if not used again.
a perfect story and ending
Guardians as usual continue their magical trek through the galaxy with lots of heart and good music. Content of this episode of Guardians was vast still it was compacted well and delivered methodically. Interesting message on deciding what's sacrificial to an audience that exists in a world rapidly mechanizing. Light hearted interactions has been a remarkable quality of guardians series. First class visual effects as always. Great performances by the cast while so much of the story dependent on CGI. Guardians being focused on a band of characters with a good playlist playing in the background is always a treat.
"A gut puncher and one hell of a thrilling ride. A near perfect conclusion to the Trilogy and character arcs, an absolute must see."
James Gunn was cooking!!! One of the best marvel movie ever. Very sad and funny parts. High evolutionary is top 3 best marvel villians. Everyone was well written
Well. At least James Gunn can still make a good MCU movie after Endgame. Now there really is no where left to go. For the love of god. Stop. Making. More. You. Money. Hungry. Mouse.
One of the worst Marvel movies to date.
A Great film that had me in tears as much as it had me smiling. THE MCU IS not done!!!
"Um √≥timo filme, assim como os anteriores, se torna melhor ainda estando em meio a tantos fracassos de lan√ßamento, o que n√£o apaga sua hist√≥ria envolvente e emocionante de amizade e hero√≠smo."
Love the first F-Bomb
An absolute James Gunn masterpiece and a strong and characteristic last hurrah to the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. A real joyride and the characterisation of the High Evolutionary worked really well in contrast to the titular characters. The soundtrack and album was excellent as well. Overall an extremely solid film in the MCU.
"This movie was legendary! It was a perfect conclusion to the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. It gave each and every character an amazing character arc and ending. James Gunn did an amazing job giving each character an ending without killing them off. The movie had a great villain that definitely brought the stakes of the movie to a whole new level. The soundtrack for this movie is amazing and has been stuck in my head for days. With the end of the original Guardians, a new lineup is born and I can't wait to see what's next for the Guardians of the Galaxy!"
One of the best movies of all time.
"I love Rocket! The third (and final?) Guardians movie dives deeper into Rocket‚Äôs past. It explores the concept of protecting animals, which I love. It‚Äôs weird and entertaining. Very creative ideas throughout."
This was perfect! A great ending to a great trioligy
"Definitely one of my new MCU faves- This movie is SO emotional (one of if not the most emotionally-devastating MCU movie to date), hilarious, gorgeous, and highlights characters like Rocket and Nebula beautifully. You have to watch."
"This movie is totally different to the others. Whilst there is some humour it is overshadowed by the very graphic depictions of animal cruelty, suffering and overwhelming sadness. I really cannot think why a movie in this series has been made spending so much time making the audience miserable and upset. Whilst the majority of the movie is CGI, the detail and sentiment left me feeling completely deflated, miserable, and annoyed that I had payed to be made to feel that way.  No more of these movies for me."
"So much heavier than the first 2 films, and didn't match the awesome tone of them either. The film had some beautiful and raw moments."
"The final GOTG film balances the usual wacky humour, with an emotionally powerful plot surrounding the origins of Rocket."
Now that's how you wrap up a trilogy!
"Best Guardians of the Galaxy film yet! Great acting, great CGI, great plot, great villain, great humor, great action scenes, and the first film to ever make me actually shed a tear. 5/5 stars. You 100% should watch this."
Amazing 3rd installment to my favorite MCU trilogy.
I loved the first two films but wasn‚Äôt anticipating this one. Marvel films have made me (a life long superhero fan) question if I was suffering from the dreaded ‚Äúsuperhero burn out‚Äù. But I wanted to get out so I saw this‚Ä¶ and loved it so much.
""
"I think this is my favorite of the trilogy and only improves upon what I loved in the first two films. These characters that on paper are so silly, had me in tears. I am so grateful I got to see this Trillogy of films unfold on the big screen. One day I‚Äôll be telling my kids about when I went to see Guardians, just like my father tells me of seeing Star Wars in 77."
""
"If you‚Äôve seen the first two and are for some reason debating on seeing this one, watch it now! You aren‚Äôt tired of superhero films, you‚Äôre tired of lazy ones."
"This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Amazing ending to a great trilogy, James Gunn really puts his all into this film and it shows."
"Huge mistake taking Rocket out of play for the current day storyline.  Gamora felt jammed in unnecessarily.  Just over all a very disappointing movie.  Very glad I waited till Disney+ as I think this may be the worst movie the MCU has done, only Secret Invasion is below this."
Chris Pratt the goat!
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3"" is a perfect blend of action, comedy, and heartfelt emotions. This movie is a masterpiece that will leave you crying, laughing, scared, thrilled, and amazed all at once."
""
"The central theme of this movie is friendship, and the bond between the characters is simply phenomenal. Each character is given their moment to shine, and their unique personalities make for a hilarious and heartwarming experience."
""
"The comic accuracy of this movie is top-notch, and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The CGI is seamlessly integrated, and the vibrant colors and vivid backgrounds and scenery will leave you in awe."
""
"The storyline is well-crafted, and the pacing is perfect. The action sequences are thrilling and leave you on the edge of your seat. The emotional moments are handled with care, and you can't help but feel invested in the characters' journeys."
""
"The cast is impeccable, and their performances are outstanding. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista deliver powerful performances that are both hilarious and emotional. The addition of new characters such as Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary played by Will Poulter and Chukwudi Iwuji, added depth and complexity to the story."
""
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3"" is a must-see movie that will have you crying tears of joy, laughing out loud, scared of the villains, thrilled by the action, and amazed by the visuals. The central theme of friendship makes this movie all the more special, and you will leave the theater feeling inspired to cherish the people and animals in your life."
"This was the perfect ending to such an incredible trilogy. Finally getting to see the origin of rocket as well as some great emotional moments will leave you sad, but happy, but satisfied all at one time. The villain is also one of the darker ones in the MCU, but this was just such a great finish to my favorite marvel trilogy."
Kids liked it with the Racoon in trouble and not a bad storyline. The first film remains the best as is often the way.
a wonderful conclusion to the Guardians arc.
would have been a 5/5 but there were certain things that happened in the film that I couldn't suspend my disbelief.
This movie was amazing and i would Watch it over and over again
I've just watched this movie and really enjoyed it. As usual the soundtrack was brilliant and the plot was easy to follow.
Rockets back story really got to me and it really made me think about animal experiments in the real world.
I used to go to see every marvel film but this is the only part of the franchise I really enjoy now. There was still a lot of laugh out loud moments as well as the sad parts and the story kept me hooked.
A lot of the other marvel films have plots so complex I can't follow what's going on. They also seem very repetitive and the run time is far too long.
I think Stan Lee is a big miss to the Marvel films. I used to enjoy spotting his cameos and maybe he had a say on the plots.
The Iron Man films had a lot of humour and I think recent Marvel ensemble movies have missed the mark.
I hope there will be another Guardians of the Galaxy film at some point in the future or that some of the characters will be in other films.
"At the moment, apart from the Galaxy series, I'm all marveled out"
"√â muito bom, adorei a hist√≥ria do Rocket Raccoon, me fez chorar a hist√≥ria √© muito bom... Adorei tudo nesse filme tenho nenhuma cr√≠tica!!!"
"9/10. One of my favourite comic book movies ever. Has great character archs, emotion, comedy and story. Theres no unnecessary filler and has an amazing payoff/ending to an almost perfect trilogy of movies. The final fight is really great and gives you a ncie sense of joy, and Peter and Gamoras character archs are really well handeld by James Gunn. Would recomend to anybody."
Some scenes were hard to stomach
As good as the first film.
"es todo lo que el cine de super heroes debio ser, es glorioso, no me gusta que no muera nadie, pierde un poco de seriedad al conflicto de querer salvar las vidas, pero la tension que genera el saber como deparara el destino es muy buena, muy bien manejados los personajes, y solo tengo una cosa que decir su nombre es roket roket raccon"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fitting finale to this trilogy of MCU movies. It's heavier & more violent than its precursors, but it manages to retain some of the levity this series is known for to keep things from getting too dark. This emotional rollercoaster is longer than it needed to be, with some sloppy screenplay moments to justify certain plot points and move things along. And the ending feels rushed as it tries to wrap everything up. I don't agree with all the decisions James Gunn made during Guardians 3, but I do think that it's an exciting ride that is on par with the other two movies."
"I never thought that the third Guardians of the Galaxy would be my favorite film of all the superhero films, the film knows how to divide drama, comedy and action, and all the themes are VERY well worked on, the action in this film is incredibly well filmed (it had to be James Gunn), the characters are impossible not to like and the film delves a lot into Rocket Racoon's past, which is wonderful, James Gunn's humor is very good, in some scenes it gets very juvenile but it doesn't bother me, I give it 10/10."
For me the last few marvel movies were a big disappointment but this movie was a super fun watch
"It's good, I loved it."
a great conclusion to the best mcu trilogy
"Maravillosa, indescriptible, emocional y memorable, una carta de amor al g√©nero de la ciencia ficci√≥n y tambi√©n al lado m√°s humilde del ser humano, una epopeya maravillosa que nos deja en claro que no se necesita una historia soberbia o compleja para atraparte y llegar al coraz√≥n"
It's easy to tell that the conclusion to the Guardians of the galaxy team is phenomenal when it puts a smile on your face even when you tear up- which you definitely will.
Brilliantly made movie. I really love how they portray the story. Always wanted to see Rocket's past and this movie has done a tremendous job in that. Just loved it.
"A Well done final part for the Guardians of the Galaxy. I've laughed, cried, was excited and had a big smile on my face at the end of the movie. It's definitely worth it watching it!!!"
The movie was satisfying to watch the scenes and the cgi was really good I think this movie is one of the best in the MCU.
"Good movie, the most moving and emotional of the Guardians movies. Definitely recommend."
THis movie was just beautiful. What a way to end it.
"The movie would have been great except for the ending. What an insult to Guardians of the Galaxy fans, it's as if volume 1 and volume 2 didn't matter to the writers. Don't watch, it will ruin it for you."
By far the best Marvel movie in recent times. Plot is amazing and fun while also heart wrenching. A must see for all Marvel fans
Surprisingly good?????
"Great characters, great style, takes marvel into a darker tone without removing the humor completely."
"It is extremely emotional, I actually indeed cried to this movie.. But yeah there is good suspense, good acting, and so much action! And overall, ""I am Groot."""
"It was terrible. Multiple cringe moments when I nearly turned it off.  Very weak writing, overacting, and childish. Haven't been this disappointed since The Force Awakens. Although the soundtrack was pretty good."
Best gotg movie!!!!!!!
awesome! dont know what so say but it had great acting and emotions! always watch movies with my friends so always it makes ur experience better
"Melhor despedida imposs√≠vel, a carga dram√°tica, as cenas de a√ß√£o, pode-se afirmar com certeza que guardi√µes da gal√°xia e a melhor trilogia da Marvel e que esse capitulo fechou com chave de ouro."
A masterpiece! the perfect ending to this great trilogy! Be advised: prepare to cry
"If this is the last film, they've gone out with a bang! Smashed this one out of the park! It has everything including a tear!"
The true ending to the MCU.
Best ending of any trilogy l have ever seen.
"Certainly one of the best films I've ever seen, the emotional weight that this film brings is absurd and is a ""breathing"" for Marvel today"
James gunn masterfully crafting another banger!
Wonderful romp! Enjoyed every minute. Laughed. Cried.
This was so much better than we had expected. a very fun movie. Our 8 yr old also really enjoyed it.  Great cast!
The film was one of the best movies ever made in cinematic history. Shout-outs to the cast (especially Chris Pratt) and to the amazing James Gunn.
"As usual, amazing. Watch past the credits. Starlord will return"
I loved the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies but the third one is dreadful in every way. Terrible plot(s) and terrible dialog and terrible screenplay and silly  dialog made painfully obvious the shortcomings of the actors.
""
Editing out  an hour of the CGI fight scenes and explosions would have also helped. It would have been a kindness to the audience to shorten their suffering through this picture.
""
The music was great with GG Vol I and OK with GG Vol II but awful with GG Vol III. Many people bought the soundtrack for GG I and GG II but doubt anyone is going to buy the soundtrack for this movie.
Great emotional scenes. Loved seeing Rockets story. everything we expect from James Gunn.
it was an emotional ride.
"Great film all around with an adequate amount of humor while also incorporating a meaningful plot. Seemed to get a tad off track while attempting to save one of their own, however it still managed to make the viewer engage in the rest."
"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. The CGI is beautiful, the writing is impeccable, and as always, the music choices are perfect. Even though the other 2 Gaurdians movies were much more lighthearted, I liked the change of pace. I liked seeing those hilarious heartwarming characters be put in a much darker situation. Every moment of it was amazing."
"Talk about a downward spiral...G3 is by far the worst of the trilogy, giving me Return of the Jedi vibes, with its obvious play for younger audiences with the talking animals (and then killing them), while throwing in the customary f-bomb to earn the PG-13 rating. Gunn and much of the cast seem to have phoned in their work on this sprawling flick that could've easily been shaved by 15-20 minutes. Short on substance and lacking focus, Gunn relies on nostalgia of past characters in the series, daft little one-liners, and raw emotions to carry the day. And even then, Gamora & Star-Lord end up going their separate ways...how can a fan of the series be pleased with that?"
"Really beautiful! I love the Guardians Of The Galaxy sequence, it's simply spectacular! So emotional that I cried at several moments. Happiness, sadness, fear, surprise; A mix of feelings!"
"I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it yet, because it's a spectacular movie!! üíó‚ú®üí´"
"I loved GotG, but was disappointed by the sequel. But I can gratefully report that this 3rd film has much of the unexpected charm of the original. The actors were uniformly good, and there were many laugh-out-loud scenes."
"Not only my favorite in the guardians trilogy, but also in the MCU. The Costumes were amazing and the acting was funny. The soundtrack was also my favorite out of the three. This is a must-see for any Marvel or guardians fans."
Very twisted very warped story and what‚Äôs with the ending? Everybody dances and then agrees never to see each other again? I don‚Äôt get it. I like the original cast of characters but what the heck is with the script?
"Absolute fan service, had me tearing up at times. Also great music choice."
"At last a marvel movie that doesn‚Äôt feel formed within the depths of a factory. It has real characters, humour, a touching story and a director who truly cares about the genre of superheroes. A satisfying send off to the franchise."
So good. Great way to end this trilogy.
"It lack the playfulness of the originals, which had made it stand out from the other Marvel movies. The 3rd was dark, violent and mean spirited in comparison. It left me depressed."
Great but sad ending to a great trilogy Miss some of the charm though.
This is indeed the perfect way to end of such an amazing triology!  This movie made me cry a few times because of how emotionally charming it was! High evolutionary is so despicable that you hate him so much for what he has done to innocent animals. Definitely the stakes in this movie remind me of no way home when I had a blast. I highly recommend watching this movie once in your life! Perfect conclusion!
The first two movies I still tear up when I watch them. Guardians 3 ended with me feeling relieved it was over.

"All they did was scream non-stop for 2 hours at each other. And not in a heartwarming way either. It wasn't funny, and they let one of the most sadistic, insane villains live??? Ronin was nothing compared to this guy, and they killed him! And Ego too."
""
"And now Groot apparently is Mr. Swiss Army Knife who saves the day! I have not liked this new ""thick"" Groot."
""
I will be just fine considering the Guardians over with the second one and throwing this one out.
"La mejor pel√≠cula de superh√©roes de la historia. Con un coraz√≥n enorme, un gran soundtrack, unos personajes maravillosos, villano genial y la lista de cosas buenas sigue."
Lacks the character charm of the previous outings and trys too hard to make you have all the feels. Jokes and heartstring pulls are too long and in  your face. Whole movie was about 30min too long.  That said it was way better than the entirety of the post infinity mcu era.
Best post-endgame MCU movie by far to date.
"""A incredibly fitting end to an incredible trilogy!  Top to bottom  this is the best Marvel trilogy there is. Period!"""
I love this movie so much that want to have a pet raccoon because of this movieü¶ù
Best Guardians movie yet. Lots to like and no complaints from the people that liked the first two I think.
"Guardians of the Galaxy 3. A truly beautiful movie that could possibly be the end of an amazing trilogy. You sit in your seat watching the scenes and plot develop. You don't even notice how you dance almost every 10 minutes. From classic oldies like ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone to newer songs like ""Dog Days Are Over"" by Florence and The Machine. The music isn't only there so you dance; it carries the whole movie along with it. Every decision in music was precise and chosen to be played loudly or quietly in the background. Next time you watch, pay attention to how many times you want to sing along or boogie along with the tune. Even Drax might dance with you. As the music is important, it follows along with the plot"
"Twists and turns. Back stories. Throughout the entire movie you learn more and more about the characters you have already learned to love. You begin watching a drunk sad man, Peter Quill, stumbling and yelling at everyone around him. A big gold man comes bursting in and then the thrill begins. Going back and forth not only in conflicts but also in emotions. It went from chaos to sadness to happiness and all back over again. When Rocket, one of the favorite characters, is on his deathbed. Throughout the first two movies you never knew where he came from and how he became a talking racoon. The movie incorporates the guardians trying to save him while he is relieving how he became who he is. The sadness and passion and excitement all play together to make a glorious film. Definitely watch for an amazing emotional rollercoaster where you might even end up dancing, crying, and laughing all at the same time."
"actually loved this! high evolutionary has to come back! great villian, wonderful end to the guardians."
"Excelente pel√≠cula, un hermoso final para esta trilog√≠a que fue sin dudas de lo mejor que hizo Marvel Studios. Es una pel√≠cula y un cierre genial, culminando la historia de estos personajes que cautivaron a todo el mundo por lo divertidos e interesantes que son. Este grupo se siente bastante distinto a todos los dem√°s, porque que son una familia y a todo momento se siente eso. Esta tercera parte esta al nivel de las anteriores dos, no se si es mejor que las dos pero si puedo decir que es la que mas te llega al coraz√≥n, hace que olvides todo y te concentres solo en lo que estas viendo en pantalla, y siendo una monta√±a rusa de emociones con la que lloras, te reis, sonr√≠es, te pones tenso, etc. La verdad es que esto es lo que no encontraba en una pel√≠cula de Marvel hace mucho, quer√≠a preocuparme por los personajes y tener miedo por si les pasa algo grave y ac√° se sinti√≥ eso. El trabajo de James Gunn es maravilloso, construyo la historia de cada uno de los personajes para terminar de darles este cierre tan hermoso. Algo que me gusta mucho de esta cinta es que no tenes que verte otras del UCM para entenderla, con ver las anteriores dos ya esta. Por otro lado, la banda sonora sigue siendo genial y mejora muchas escenas. Tambi√©n las actuaciones son muy buenas, principalmente las de Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda√±a, Will Poulter, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Chukwudi Iwuji, Bradley Cooper, etc. En conclusi√≥n, una muy buena pel√≠cula y un excelente cierre para estos personajes, esta al nivel de las anteriores dos y hasta las puede superar seg√∫n el criterio, por lejos lo mejor de Marvel en el ultimo tiempo. Muy recomendada."
"Shouty, chaotic,  bad jokes, storyline all over the place. Did not think it could be worse than Vol. 2...."
"Un film imperfetto ma tremendamente sincero e toccante.Un James Gunn pi√π maturo e amaro..e infinitamente pi√π dolce al tempo stesso,ha realizzato quest'opera unica, vera, autentica, che risulta essere di gran lunga il film Marvel pi√π devoto e sentito degli ultimi anni."
Meno brillante e riuscito dal punto di vista 'comico' rispetto agli altri due ma ancora pi√π accorato e toccante.
Un'autentica spremuta di cuore.Da vedere e rivedere per poter apprezzare questo modo di fare cinema cos√¨ libero e cristallino..
"This is THE BEST freaking Marvel movie EVER for me. Better than civil war, better than the last spiderman. It is just sooo emotionally jam-packed with every single freaking character being a real person that I have gasped in wonder about 5 times while watching the movie, saying ""James Gun is a freaking genious!"". And I study for directing!"
""
God damn this movie shouldn't exist and yet it does. One of the best movies EVER. It has brought back my will to live!
Still has the fun for the third time. The soundtrack also rocks as always.
Not as good as the first two.  I was disappointed.
Procrastinated on seeing this for a long time because Marvel(Disney) has dropped the ball so hard.  Didn't expect much.  But I was very pleasantly surprised.  James Gunn succeeds where Watiti fails: cutting heavy moments with humor without it being annoying.
""
"The banter was good, a little forced at times but mostly really solid.  The action was good, the cgi was good, everything felt right."
""
"I also have to admit I cried more than once during the movie, which is embarrassing but speaks to the emotional strings they successfully tugged on.  Bummed this is the last installment."
I cannot figure out what to say about this movie other than it was amazing. So much emotion throughout. This one will make you laugh hysterically out loud and it'll make you sob like a baby. It was the perfect send off for this team of Guardians
Amazing conclusion to the gotg. Only downfall personally is the villain not being the best
"This is a good farewell to the Guardians of the Galaxy. This had me in tears and had me laughing , this movie had me more excited than endgame. Masterpiece, I will never forget about seeing this movie. Thank you James Gunn for making one of the best trilogies of all time."
"Horrible movie,  they ruined the whole franchise...very disappointing."
That is the worst Marvel to date
All they do is bicker it's so old
Nothing made sense and the humour is terrible
Hard to see after the first one so perfect and this one so horrible
Way to long. Tedious and a real letdown.
"DO NOT LET SMALL CHILDREN WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!! Um wtf?!  What happened to the series?? 1 & 2 are great, funny, heartfelt, action packed, family movies. But this third one? Dark. Sinister. Cruel. Disturbing. Horrific. And for the entire length of the movie, not just a portion. Literally from scene one to the credit reel. And on NUMEROUS levels. Sure, see it once to see it. But my partner and I both agreed without hesitation that we'll GLADLY never watch it again. If this was the directors payback for the whole ‚Äòfiring situation' -well done. You've done the damage. It's been days and I'm still thinking about how DISTURBING the whole thing was. 2.5 stars instead of 1 only because I f it was strictly an adult movie, okay, sure, great, whatever. But it's not. I don't even think it should be rated PG-13. I cannot NOT suggest this movie enough."
Havent watched such an emotional roller-coaster in a hot min
"OK, was a little dark in places, but a great background story for Rocket, and how the team hangs together."
""
I like that they set the ending to leave open the opportunity for future Guardians movies.  Rocket is the best!
Meh it was a long backstory film not original.
"I cried, laughed, was impressed by the graphics and direction. The 'Guardians of the Galaxy' trilogy is probably the best Marvel movie."
"Horrible movie. It lacked heart, downplayed other characters while up-playing lower characters, used cliche movie tropes, and used dark gore and a pointless f-word. They also said to themselves ""if you get in a rut, make them argue""."
"Holy cow - I cannot believe some of the accolades this movie has gotten. It was poorly written, hard to follow, and poorly executed overall. The main cast has gotten doughy yet stiff. The relationships no longer feel warm and fuzzy. They are disfunctional to the extreme."
""
The costumes look like something made on the show Face Off.
""
The only likable characters were apparently incinerated. I don't know. I had to stop.
"I cried many times during this movie. Def reccomended. It had emotion, great music and the final scenes with the fight against the god complex dude were awesome. You have the feeling that everything is lost but then it gets turned around. It also didnt have gays at every corner and plot that made sense. I really enhoyed this movie and wish that everyone can feel like I do."
A huge THANK  you JG !
Hands down my favorite non avenger MCU movie!
"Increible pel√≠cula vale la pena, por todos los efectos y volveria ver toda la saga una y otra vez."
"With a mass amount of heart and loss, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 does not hold back and it is a near-perfect finalie to one of Marvel's best families"
Chorei igual crian√ßa!! Muito bom!
Cried like a baby!! Very good movie tho
que bien cierre a la historia
"Muy buena secuela, bien para adolescentes no tanto para ni√±os."
"La pel√≠cula m√°s incre√≠ble, me hizo llorar con sus giros pero super super recomendableüòç"
"Fant√°stica, la am√©, tienen que verla"
Es una peli con mucha acci√≥n y me encanta la espero pronto
Una fabulosa pel√≠cula con grandes actores
Es una pel√≠cula Un poco confusa que est√° afuera de las Narrativas de marvel excelentes im√°genes la m√∫sica es asombrosa es una pel√≠cula de acci√≥n y excelentes di√°logos.
Nunca me cansar√© de esta franquicia es un hit!!!
"A fantastic emotional conclusion to this iteration of the Guardians, showing Marvel do still have it."
"Stakes are high, character development is at a high and with a truly depressing yet investing storyline of Rocket Raccoon being the heart and soul of the film. Guardians 3 is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat as well as leaving you a emotional mess."
"As a Guardians of the Galaxy fan boy‚Ä¶ this one pains me. This ""episode"" was by far my least favorite one. The connection with Rocket and his past life / friends was great, but overall I felt the story line was dragged out with flashbacks and a pathetic villain who I feel like anyone in the Marvel universe could take out. It wasn't bad but in my opinion after how well the first 2 went‚Ä¶ I was expecting more"
"If you're a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy, as I was (was!), avoid this movie. I have never seen a major release like this contain so many awful cliches. This was downright painful to watch. You know how sometimes you watch a sequel or episode that is so bad that it retroactively ruins what came before it, you know, like the finale of Game of Thrones? This is that kind of movie. ChatGPT could write a better and more original screenplay."
"Emocionante e √©pico. S√≥ queria que o Adam Warlock fosse mais fiel com os quadrinhos, mas entendo que nesse filme ele √© s√≥ uma ""crian√ßa"" e ainda est√° aprendendo certas coisas."
"I have never been a big fan of the Guardians movies and was skeptical about this one when it came out.  But I heard good things about it so I decided to give it a go.  And, it was pretty meh.  It was too long and the story didn't really do anything for me.  There were multiple threads of the plot that seemed like they were trying to pull at your heart strings, but I really wasn't moved."
A great finale to the trilogy that conserves the fun style of the first two while also experimenting with a darker tone that succeeds in delivering a passionate conclusion for the group.
"What the hell happened to this series.  This was horrible, didn't even make it to the end."
"Well, that was one very depressing movie with a few laughs in between, ""The Legendary Star-Lord Will Return."" at the end doesn't make it better, since it looks like there won't be a Vol. 4."
"The perfect closure for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Great story, great performances & great soundtrack"
If you love the other Guardians films you will certainly love this one
Muy buena pel√≠cula recomendada
Excelente pel√≠cula üòÅ
Excelente pel√≠cula üëç
"I love the movie, marvel doing nice movies as usual"
I thought the idea of the new characters from the previous movie is quite refreshing especially in its thought on continuity with the Disney plus series.
"I watch all the series' films; this is my favorite of the three so far. It felt like an improvement over previous films in suspense, character development, and execution. Overall, it is a fantastic film if it's the last one with the original characters it left on a high note."
It was ok.  Definitely had it's great moments.  The flashback scenes for Rocket's backstory were amazing.  But other than that...it was just ok.  Not as good as the first movie.
"I was crying 90% of the time and now when I clear my mind all I hearr is ""Rocket,Teefs, Floor go now"". I can't stop thing about the fact that star lord almost died. I will NEVER be able to watch it again. It was not a funny guardians movie that they usually show. The fact Gamora was a ravager was just not a good move."
"Most definitely shed a tear 10 times, the high of this movie has to be rockets flashbacks. The playlist was wonderful, like always. Definitely left me wondering if we will get another ü•≤"
"Just as fresh as the previous two, with fewer comic points but with more depth to the story. A worthy ""see you next time"" from the guardians."
James Gunn is a genius. He ended the trilogy in the best way possible not only leaving all the characters journey after the guardians to fan interpretation. He has also left space for a new story to be told for star lord. I also enjoyed the darker tone but would have enjoyed a bit more humor.
TBEST MOVIE EVER (in recent times)
"Hot, not funny trash. Same old boring jokes. Terrible script. Slow. Made for the lesser humans."
"I know Disney owns Marvel now but don't make Guardians into a Disney-esque movie.  I don't watch Marvel to see dancing, and the entire movie was like watching an extended video with a lot of sad, tortured animals. So not like the first Guardians, which was so awesome."
""
Disney will be the ruin of all things Marvel.
Hugely disappointing sendoff for the best cast in Marvel. Didn't feel like a Guardians movie at all. Not funny and really boring. Almost turned it off halfway through.
"Loved vol. 1 and 2, Amazing, fun, wonderful fantastic, I don't have the words for. But obviously the meter for vol.3 has been rigged to reflect all three because of the exceptionally Great rating instead of standing alone, it would get rotten to the core, OR someone has boosted it hopping to generate interest, really wishing the RT was a little more honest."
""
Down to brass tacks. This movie is horrifying. Animal cruelty doesn't begin to describe it. The producer and writer are SICK. Only someone so Twisted could come up with a rabbit with its skin's ragged edges hanging off 8 robotic spider legs and a steal muzzle bolted to its face. The other animals were just as horrifying with NO purpose other then to crush your soul and bring ecstasy to the truly twisted and disgusting minds of the writer/producer.
""
On the upshot I think the actors after seeing the monstrosity they would have to act in were pretty happy they would never have to come back. Through the movie they tended to be pretty miserable. You can tell when the only light point comes from The Dog.
""
"On a final note, If you like seeing kittens tortured and killed on the internet this movie is for you. Everyone else Give it a PASS!"
Not as good as the first two. Rather too heavy. But the acting and script is still enjoyable. Why Gommorah though?
Really fun. Best Marvel movie in a long time.
Sadly this is the last movie of the trilogy. Amazing and emotional movie. Great acting and just great storytelling. And ofc it's James Gunn is back with the great soundtracks.
"It was a really great movie and although not as great as the first 2 it's definitely better than Multiverse Of Madness and the new Antman. It's funny but also makes you walk out of the theater with tears from Rockets heartwarming backstory. The only real problem I have with it is bringing back Gamora and not explaining how or why, it defeats the purpose and sadness of her dying and sets the example of now every person can be brought back magically."
"The worst of the 3, but didn't feel like i wasted my time or money."
""
"I respect what they tried here. It really is different from anything else you expect from Marvel/Disney at this point. There isn't a happy ending here where everyone hugs, the story is very dark/disturbing for a Disney product, with animal testing and torture as the main plot of the movie."
""
"They really tried to do something different, and while it was entertaining, it wasn't the feelings you expect to feel from a Guardians movie. The comedy was very minimal in trade for a more serious plot. The music didn't strike the normal high points it normally does....i should have known when creep was the intro song to the movie that it was going to be a depressing time."
""
"Ultimately this movie will turn off alot of viewers. It was overly sad i'd say, without the happy ending you need to bring it all back together. My wife couldn't finish it she was so sad by the plot."
""
"And sidenote......Adam Warlock......just felt sooooo shoehorned into this movie for no reason?I literally dont know what his motive for being in the movie was, besides getting revenger for his mommy? but that seemed to go away pretty quickly, almost for no reason..."
"James Gunn is back in full power for the MCU and he does bring the Guardians of the Galaxy movie with most heart when compared with the previous installments. It does respect the typical MCU formula, but it adds an extra spice thanks to spot-on comedy moments and a small reflexion on loss, grief and getting back what was once lost. The entire cast delivers (as in previous movies), but the spotlight goes to Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) this time, with Zoe Saldana shinning brighter in some scenes."
""
"First of all, Guardians takes place after the many events of the MCU and while one could expect it to focus on Peter Quill's internal dramas, it takes on a fresh new direction and explores Rocket's past while giving the audience a lesson about what true friendship really means. It is also a statement about animal cruelty for scientific testing and it reaches the highest emotional points when exploring this specific material. This installment's villain - High Evolutionary - might not be the most interesting one, but the exploitation of his ideas on the narrative have a much deeper meaning than most of the MCU villains (with Thanos being the exception). I don't want to give away the plot, but the Guardians of the Galaxy go on an adventure to save Rocket and they have to uncover his sad and cruel past in order to do so."
"Technically, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 features the best visual effects work from the group of heroes installments - it's a massive/extravaganza CGI festival full of detail - which elevates some eye-popping production design. The spaceships, the world-building, Rocket & Groot... a visual feast when combined with great makeup and hair works (a department that always impressed in the Guardians' movies). In terms of sound editing and (specially) mixing, it also delivers beautifully, providing an immersive experience in the intergalactic semi-epic adventure."
"Still, there are some characters with plenty of potential that were introduced but were kept underused during the whole movie: Adam Warlock (played by Will Poulter), Ura (played by Daniela Melchior) and Ayesha (portrayed by Elizabeth Debicki). All three are introduced in narrative and all three show a great promise in terms of character development and potential impact in the plot, but none of them really achieve relevance besides Warlock. BUT... I have to praise Gunn for not falling into the genre's usual clich√®s specially for [SPOILER] not going for a standard happy ending [END OF SPOILER]."
"And then, there's the great tunes we are used to. ""Dog Days Are Over"" is going to play on your head for days, for sure."
""
"In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an upgrade from the previous installment and it stands way above the bar of the most recent MCU movies post-Avengers: Endgame events. A fun cinematic experience for non-MCU fans and a must-see for the faithful fans!"
"Oh, my, goodness! What a perfect movie! The sentiment, the heart, the story, the music. Amazing feats of entertainment and the best marvel phase 4 film and a breath of fresh air for marvel fans. The only thing I don't appreciate is the F-word being used, it wasn't needed but they put it in there anyway. But I am willing to skip that one word because of how phenomenal this movie is!"
Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Three is a perfect fiery trilogy
"Whilst not as good as the first Guardians of the Galaxy, it's much better than the 2nd and the best Marvel film I've seen since No Way Home. It's funny, with good action. The end seemed a bit forced, and felt like they all went their seperate ways because the actors were leaving as opposed to actual story reasons. But for the most part it was good."
"Sorry just not up to par with the first one. And way to dark and depressing. Best thing this time around was Chukwudi Iwuji's theatrics. Great actor, wish Marvel had given him a different villian to play though."
"I've always loved the look of Guardians of the Galaxy, especially because the characters' makeup is done manually, reminiscent of space movies from the 80s. Too bad that all of this is always wasted with a weak plot. In this film, I liked the focus on Rocket Raccoon, the character I always found most interesting in the group. The narrative of his past and all the emotional charge involved is great, but the saga of the others to save him is long and without depth. Peter Quill was largely unimportant, focusing nearly all of his screen time on winning over Gamora. He might not have appeared in the movie, and the story would still be the same. The film leaned heavily on Mantis and Drax's humor; at least they're funny, or watching this movie in its entirety would have been harder than Vol. 2."
Simply a must see! Great Marvel!
Bringing back someone who should be dead without good a good explicate why is lazy story telling. This way a dead means nothing and everyone can come back. They dumped down the charachters even more. The guy that is 100x stronger then them is out of nothing weak and cannot do anything anymore beside becomming good and helping them. The only good story is the backstory of rocket. For the rest they are dropping the ball for me just like all thier latest movies.
Fantastic culmination to a great trilogy.
Great! Best Guardians movie so far(not to mention Rockets back-story)
"A very funny movie with a lot of action and quite emotional, this movie teaches you a lot about different values."
"First 2 were by far more fun in my books, although the 4 stars is a little generous in my opinion it was a good close to the trilogy. Biggest gripe was I felt the movie ran too long."
"Once again, Guardians of the Galaxy proves to be the only superhero ensemble that really works in the cinema (bravo James Gunn!)."
""
"Two and a half hours that fly by, with laughs, tears, and most importantly, all the characters getting their fair share and their moment to shine, all accompanied, as always in the saga, by a very special musical selection."
Me gustar√≠a que por lo menos matar√°n a un personaje (eso no son√≥ tan bien) pero sigue siendo una obra de arte
"Um filme que traz a mistura de drama, com√©dia e a√ß√£o. Achei o filme com uma atua√ß√£o, est√©tica e roteiro super interessantes e com uma boa perfei√ß√£o, como sempre, o James Gunn impacta a ind√∫stria cinematogr√°fica com mais uma de suas obras. Mas, acho que o filme poderia ser mais complexo em algumas √°reas como o passado do Drax e uma rememoriza√ß√£o do passado da Quill, Gamora e at√© mesmo do grupo, j√° que √© o √∫ltimo filme desse grupo que ficar√° eternizado em nossos cora√ß√µes."
"Anyone praising this movie is fooling themselves and just refusing to admit what a fiasco it was.  This should have been a runaway block buster, but it barely broke even.  Why do they have to screw with the working formula.  Good versus evil.  Good wins.  Everyone lives happily ever after.  No.  They just have to get creative, do something different and ruin it."
""
"It was great to see the characters again, but this was not the fun roller coaster ride the previous two movies were.  Even the lighthearted Christmas special was better.  Most of the characters, even main characters, seem to just be there for filler and have little to do.  Everyone in this movie is unhappy and sad - except for maybe Drax who has no concept of empathy and he just comes off as being insensitive.  The movie is dark, cold and cruel.  VERY cruel!  I want my Guardians to have fun bickering banter while they fight the bad guy.  Everyone in this movie seems to feel hopeless right from the start.  The movie tries to be funny sometimes, but it's unsuccessful.  The plot is so serious and mean that it can't be funny.  A sad end for the franchise.  Even the characters seemed glad it was over.  I was hoping for a ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" type of ending, but I feel like I got a Schindler's List ending."
""
I did have a favorite character though.  Cosmo the dog.
James Gunn can do no wrong.
The first GotG is on a league of its own. The second - misses a few hits.
"GotG 3 with its rewrites related to personal events that were outside of James Gunn's control, is completely worth the wait."
""
"The movie is about relationships, people, ""one last ride"" kinda adventure where you learn to accept people, move on and still have ""appreciate the moment"" scenes where you can kick ass."
""
"I couldn't write a cheesier summary of the movie if I wanted, it just has it all."
"Small jokes between the GotG main cast, are paid off and expanded."
""
"Everyone gets what they deserve in a way that makes sense, to me at least."
""
"I have no idea if there's going to be another GotG or if we're ever going to see all the  main cast together again, but we must appreciate them for all the movies they gave us. Great cast!"
The greatest BS ever!! Finally the No Brain generation has reached the movie writers!! Disney produces the worst shit!
It's a great final movie. I think it the best work of Jamen Gun.
"It's good. A little overstuffed, perhaps, but it gives a great send-off to the single most surprising Marvel property and manages to add a memorable villain."
"Star lord dancing to ""Come and get your love""?  Classic Guardians of the Galaxy."
Guardians 1&2 awesome.
"This movie, the third installment, not so much."
The movie opens with a depressing and violent scene and never recovers.
Just meh.
2 stars for Chris Pratt
volume 3 is a mess.  pretty much wish i had that 2.5 hour of my life back
"I absolutely love the previous GotG movies. This one was a major disappointment. I mean it was entertaining, but this one was not on the same level as the others in any way. The overall story and mission was fine, concept-wise. The script, however, was not. They tried to force so much ""humor"" that it almost became annoying. That made the feel of the movie a giant mess. The other movies had a GREAT balance of silliness, seriousness, and action. What a letdown. Forgettable movie. Suicide Squad, now this? James Gunn needs to stop directing/writing for a while. The DC Universe is so screwed with him at the helm now."
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.3 is the best Marvel movie this Year apart from Spider Across The Spiderverse this movie is so good I think they did a good job on it.
"I liked it better than the previous GotG honestly and thought it had real emotional punch, but that's why I can't recommend it for everyone. It had animal torture/death, and one scene was gutting enough where I just know some friends who feel more strongly about that would just hate it. So if that's a deal breaker for you, don't see it, but if you can shrug that off okay, then yeah it's one of the better MCU movies recently."
Tears of joy and sadness in one movie.
Actors and acting: Great and likable
CGI: Pretty good
Plot: Surprising and interesting
"Overall I had a great time watching this, but I have noticed some minor drawbacks which made me uneasy watching this.  I was hoping for some light toned action movie with a bit of comedy, but it came out as surprising Rocket's history as main movie theme which made it more like a sci fi drama. With much darker tone then previous volumes, comedic relief moments seemd forced to me and were much worse then introduced in previous movies. Also music was way worse then in previous volumes. It matched darker theme of the movie but wasn't good enough to be used as car music playlist like the previous one."
"A plodding, toddling, everything-but--the-kitchen-sink clodball of a Guardians flick that would have benefited from an intermission (it did - we took one ourselves). No rollicking, almost zero fun, stone silence from the crowd. Folks are being to kind to this one - a first-class stinker."
"A great entry into the MCU after some pretty lackluster films. This has some decent action, great emotion, and creepy animal dolls. What's not to like?"
""
What a play by James Gunn to make this and then dip out from the MCU to run the DCU!
"Weird space scene with Chris Pratt, other than that it was great."
If more of the current Marvel Phase was even close to the quality of this movie we would all be so much happier.
""
"A darker, more serious, take on the Guardians than previous films.  But not so dark that the characters ever felt forced.  In fact, the only thing I have against the movie is the single use of the ""F***"" that somebody decided needed to be forced into the dialogue."
""
"Beware of watching with younger children for violence, language, gore, and lots of implied animal cruelty."
This movie is so awesome. The Guardians silliness is great the High Evolutionary is a great villain. It's one of the best MCU movies. The walk and Hallway fight is perfection. Don't Be Rash- Adam Warlock
This movie is truly something else :')
"Bom filme, tendo cativado bem todos os intergrantes mesmo sendo focado no Rocket"
It's the best guardian movie of the trilogy
5/5
Great 3rd movie much beter then the 2cd movie
"Best marvel movie in a while (although that's not saying much). It's not perfect or as good as the original, but it still has the wit and humor it's known for. It also does a great job of switching between jokes and heavy emotional scenes (something the MCU generally struggles with)."
"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 - 10/10. Wow. I was not expecting this to be that emotional. Surprisingly, James Gunn saves his best for last, as Vol. 3 packs a loaded punch. If this just so happens to be the last of the series, then so be it! Its a wonderful emotional tale, and a surprisingly deep one at that. You do have the action and humour that is prevalent in MCU films, but here's something I wasn't expecting: the dark nature and heart of the story. Rocket takes the driver seat in terms of the plot here, and his back story in terms of why he is the way that he is is probably some of the most emotionally charged sequences in all of MCU's history. In an interview, Gunn said the first film was about the love lost from a mother and how to cope with it, the second was about the love lost from a father, and this one was the love lost from within oneself. This movie is more about letting go and refining and rediscovering oneself, and how you must love oneself too. Maybe this is recency bias, but this is definitely the best in the trilogy!"
The best one out of the Guardians' movies.

"WOW, LA GIUSTA FINE DEI GUARDIANI!"
"There is a really good strong character story line with Rocket that carries the film. The rest of the film is just filler. Characters verbalise their thoughts, feelings and internal motivations so that it's made painfully clear to the audience what that person feels and what is driving them, off with A LOT of shouting. Throughout the film characters will say that they don't kill before then explicitly stating that they are going to kill everyone and then quite graphically kill everyone before ending on the cliche of not killing the bad guy before then presumably leaving him to die. You're constantly left to fill in the blanks like why did Gamora put her clothes in the escape hatch if she knew that's what it was? Why does drax randomly know the language of a species that up until simply did not exist? Why does the entire universe speak English and why can they not understand these two species in particular? Why are those two gold people in the film as ""backup"" ? Why did they feed those three characters to three large tentacle creatures that for some reason one of the main characters just instantly recognises if their core diet is not meat? There are big name needless cameos throughout and it's very long. I mean I enjoyed it sort of but I would have enjoyed it more if they had just focused on Rocket because that at least made sense."
Perfect ending to a franchise I hope we haven‚Äôt seen the last of - loved every second of it
Wonderful coda to the series
Not wonderful but still satisfying.
This was a disappointment. It is as if they lost the narrative. Animal torture and lots of death and few laughs.
"Just left the theater and what an emotional movie. I absolutely loved this movie, it packed with so much action and emotion. James Gunn really did an amazing job with all 3 guardians movies, and definitely continued into this film. It was so awesome but also so sad to see Rockets back story and the whole tie in with Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary. BTW Will Pouler as Adam Warlock was definitely an amazing choice, his performance was great!! I give Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 a 9/10 for sure!"
"Guardians vol 3's singular goal (outside of concluding the trilogy) is to make the viewer shed a tear. The characters are almost methodically put into peril in the most emotional way possible and then saved. This overuse of pathos gets very wearying by the end of two and a half hours. It may work for some viewers, but it felt cheap to me."
"This movie, more so than the first or second movie, balances sentimentality with humor in a very profound way. Rocket is the star of the show and you get to see where he comes from, which is heartbreaking. But also beautiful and heartfelt. Each character gets their due as well. Really well done movie, I loved it."

"If you are considering watching this film, I would highly recommend it. However, I would not recommend it for children under the age of ten as it shows graphic violence and hard to watch scenes of animal cruelty but This does not make the film bad, it is the very message behind it that makes the film so unique. A lot of people will watch this film and find the scenes of rockets background too strong for a guardians of the galaxy film. despite this, I think this film helps us face the devastating truth that is what we are doing right now to our animals. The film is not all sad though, it has fun comedy, amazing fight scenes and amazing character development, and even though quills character has changed, its only due for the loss of the person he was involve with (Gomora). I think its important to address that this film is not particularly over the top in feminism as I've seen some people complain about, (Spoiler) Yes things may not have ended how people would have wanted with Peter and gmora but that is nothing to do with a 'I don't need no man' mentality  its simply due to the fact that that's not really Peters Gomora simply a past version of her. Its also important to remember they are all just aliens and don't really have genders like we do ( they are just played by male and female actors) but they do not associate with genders like we do. So basically they are just fighting to save the galaxy not to prove any extreme feminist points (end of spoiler)"
"I loved this film, it is different but that doesn't make it bad, I hope anyone who watches it will see the messages behind it as they are very important, and happy watching to all."

"A continuation of Gunn's space adventures with a cast that has some good moments, a lot of noise, and one deep and fascinating character study."
""
"When this movie focuses on the serious part of the story, it shines. With intimate, tragic, and moving writing, the film leans into what makes these character beloved and commentary that stays with you after the movie has ended."
""
"The story made me laugh and cry. But also groan at moments. There is a lot of shouting in this movie. Almost in back-to-back scenes that became tiring. But the music as always with Gunn's films, never failed to make you excited and inspired."
""
"While some characters had great moments, a couple missed the mark to the point where they could've not been in the film and it would've made no difference. And as always, some humor lands and some doesn't."

Gunn's directing comes alive in the quieter moments but also for a certain sequence that is one of the most entertaining and well directed action set pieces in the MCU.
""
"All in all ‚Äî it has great highs with a specific story it is telling but can be a slog in other parts. But it nails the landing to create a satisfying and emotional conclusion, hitting all the high notes."
"While it didn't really progress the overall story line, it did a fantastic job of telling Rocket's backstory. A great finish for this trilogy, but it does leave the door open for a whole new crew to take up the mantle."
Disturbing creatures. Sad storyline. Not funny. Avoid.
"Not much you can say, but blinking awesome!"
This is literally the greatest MCU movie of all time! I'm glad that Rocket gets to be the main protagonist of the film! He's the best hero in Marvel! The High Evolutionary is officially the most evil villain of all in Marvel! The HellSpawn are really terrifying.

It was amazing for a marvel fan it was funny and sad but worth watching
"It's the best that has come out of Marvel since End Game, but it's not a great movie. I hope this is the last for the Guardians, although it looked like they were setting up the end to pass the torch to a new generation. Probably a very diverse, non-binary, mixed race group of heroes led by a Boss Girl."
"Was terrified to see this one after Antman Quantomania, but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the film. It has a lot of heart and care in it, and genuinely compared to the rest of Phase 5 right now, it's beyond ahead, like it's embarrassing how much Marvel has fallen... But thank fuck James Gunn kept his integrity, and gave another incredible installment into his universe and the greater Marvel Universe."
"I liked it. I didn't care for the second movie. This one made up for it. It's fun, it's funny and it's even emotional. Well rounded film."
"Awesome! I wasn't expecting such a great movie, given to the latest marvel releases, but Gunn really impressed me."
"First, they dosage the drama very well, with some scenes but with a happy scene after, this was very good."
"Everything was like it should be, all characters arc were soooo good, the soundtrack never disappoint, I loved the bad words lol."
"Gunn Really end up the trilogy as good as the first movie, for me, the better and let the feeling of ending in the right moment, even I wanting more."

"James Gunn delivers again. Amazing what you can do when you treat characters with heart. His comedic timing mixed with song choices, serious, dark and heartfelt scenes is still something the MCU is trying but failing miserably at replicating. It's also refreshing to see a movie not weighed down with existential nihilism or making cheap cringe inducing political statements."
"Uma aventura emocionante do melhor n√∫cleo de her√≥is deste universo cinematogr√°fico compartilhado, a qu√≠mica entre os personagens √© excelente, a a√ß√£o e o humor est√° presente na medida certa e o drama √© extremamente emocionante a ponto de me arrancar algumas l√°grimas. N√£o √© uma obra perfeita, mas √© bem redondinha com os arcos completos e fechados de maneira coerente. Um filme que obviamente irei rever."
"I didn't like the cruelty against animals, what were you thinking, it is a family moving, my kids love the series, now they will never watch any of the movies again, you have ruin it for me and my family."
"It had some sweet spots, but was overall meh."
They saved the kids AND the animals. Golly gee whiz.

"Pedantic. Songs seemed forced and we are so over that form of cinema.  The jokes fall flat and of course, our main character, Quill is a simpering simp, true to form for Disney's crusade to rid the world of men and fill it with women boss girls who do not want to be mothers that grow old, lonely, and alone."

Utter crap...  I turned it off and not even halfway through.  Seems everything Disney touches these days eventually turns to shit.
"An ultimately satisfying goodbye to our guardians though it comes with flaws, I felt the movie was afraid to break our hearts with the end but the villain and Rocket Racoon's backstory are clear highlights and are worth watching, though can't say that about much of the rest of the film"

"Stupid humor, mediocre plot and an exorbitant amount of licensed music. This movie is literal brain rot, I will never recover the brain cells that have died watching this."
An amazing end.

Loved this franchise and am so excited to see what or if they do anything more with these characters

"Clunky, poor transitions. Felt like Thor: Love & Thunder. Awful Gunn installment"
""
Fan of Guardians Vol. 1 & Thor Ragnorak
"What is possibly a top 3 non-avengers Marvel film, this movie reminds everyone what a story should involve for greatness (a blend of humor, melancholy, stakes, and organic flow). Cooper really steals the show with his story being brought onto the screen, and he really delivers despite being CGI-ed as a raccoon. Honorable mentions to Iwuji (let's hope he blows up in Hollywood soon), Cardinelli (who really nailed her role despite already having a MCU role), and Batista (it's been fun to see him evolve as both a character and actor). The biggest shame is that Gunn won't be returning for 4."
It is a pretty good movie overall. It has some areas which I feel drag on a bit but it is an excellent finale to a brilliant trilogy. Marvel's best movie in a while and worth the watch.
Best film in the franchise by far. 10/10
"While an improvement from recent MCU entries this film still runs into the same issues of bad, overused comedy beats. This movie also needed to come out 2-3 years ago if Peter was STILL going to be harping over Gamora in this film. While I appreciated the focus on Rocket's backstory, there were far too many side characters in this movie for one story to juggle and it diluted it in the process."
"Not fun or entertaining...just dark.  Complete let down from first two films, which I watched multiple times for the laughs but won't waste my time watching this one again."
"With Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Marvel fans are treated to a film that feels like old-school Marvel; the kind of Marvel that has its visually thrilling fun without sacrificing the stakes of the objective. Juxtaposed against Marvel's meager cinema offerings as of late, it's all rather bittersweet when you stop and think about how James Gunn is unlikely to direct another Marvel film any time soon with his departure to head DC's film studio already underway. But Vol. 3 captures that lovable Guardians energy without crafting a film that feels like a straight comedy (see Vol. 2, or the last two Thor movies for reference), and thereby eliminating the urgency of the story being told. Instead viewers were given a much more somber story than we've come to associate with the team as a key member is wounded early on in the film and the focus then becomes the complicated process of restoring said wounded teammate. It's a story with surprising emotional depth considering the franchise's tone over the years. That's not to say there aren't laughs throughout (including Marvel's first ever f-bomb), but they don't dominate the movie. What results is some excellent action sequences (the hallway fight scene was arguably Marvel's best ever) anchored by some fun performances by actors who are more than familiar with their roles at this point. One caveat on the performances that must be addressed is Sylvester Stallone, who felt so painfully out of place in his one (and-a-half) scene(s) that one has to wonder if he had a bunch of other scenes cut for his woodenness. It felt like Stallone was reading a script he had received that morning from a teleprompter off-screen. It was a noticeably bad performance but it was, ultimately and thankfully, short-lived. When the dust settles it's clear that this film was meant as a remarkable signoff from a surehanded director who sought to impress both of his jobs simultaneously, and achieved that goal admirably."
"I did not expect to be so emotional. I think this should be the benchmark for Marvel films, character focused and authentic vision from a creator. Perhaps cut the Gunn family and friends cameo scenes in the middle. But this was the right conclusion to the trilogy and most characters arcs."
Acest film este foarte emo»õionant »ôi scenele de luptƒÉ sunt foarte bune
"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 has everything that makes for good popcorn cinema and so much more. Heart, humor and action at the top level, even if not every joke hits 100%. Rocket's story moves you to tears and many other moments make you emotional after so many moments with the Guardians. The High Evolutionary is also finally a villain again, which is seamlessly convincing and which you wish no good. A worthy conclusion to a part of Marvel history."
"This movie is amazing, so much emotion, action, and comedy. It is the perfect balance for a superhero movie and especially for the end of the trilogy of the guardians. I would've liked to see them take a few more risks, although I am happy with the ending and that every character found purpose for themselves, I did feel like the movie could've used something like a death to push it to the 5 star level."
"This was sooo good. Better than both Vol 1 and 2 (I don't mean those to be bad, just that this is superior). The emotion, story, action, and heart are very well executed. More mature but doesn't lose what made the Guardians who they are."
The best mcu film for a few years.
"I'm a bit late on this one, but if I'm being brutally honest I kind of gave up on marvel as some of their latest ‚Äòproduces' have really soured me to the brand. Nonetheless, I finally got around to watching Gaurdians of the Galaxy 3 because it came out on disney plus, so here are my mostly positive thoughts."
"First, lets me just say that it's a welcomed sight to see the OG suits from the comics and they look pretty good. After anlyzing all the data, I believe its safe to say that this is an average marvel movie with some of the same flaws and shortcoming that have plagued the marvel movies since phase one, but with just a little more heart and soul than what the studio has been churning out lately that takes it's self a little more seriously."
"Rocket's backstory is a focal point and easily the best part of the film. Well defining its self with a scene that is a major turning point for the character, visually explains some things that the audience may be wondering, and is perfectly acted by Bradley Cooper voicing rocket. Aside from the Rocket, all the characters really show growth in ways that was pleasant to see probably my favorite being Nebula who shows more emotion and is much more of a team player. I haven't rewatched endgame, but this seems like a well earned change of pace for the character. Finally, at the edge of my praises are the action scenes, one in peculiar I'm certain was one of the hardest to film, and the unique and visuially striking set pieces and character designs that signifies to me that the cast and crew really put the work in which is refreshing to see."
"That's about it with my praises as everything else is just business as usual for marvel. While not all of it is a drag, much of the comedy I found to either overstay it's welcome or not be funny at all. Standard villain problem, as this villain rather bland and  generic and in particular with this one I found this villain to graid on my nerves with how annoying and actually uninvolved this villains is with the plot. Someone in another review pointed it out, and rather rightly so that this villain, in the movie, just a worst version of Thanos. And last, but definitely not least, my biggest issue of the film is that while his costume is pretty good, Adam Warlock is wasted in this film. Honestly, in my opinion just a shameless ploy to get genuine fans of marvel who are burnt out with franchise back into the theater and it's not appreciated. He wasn't around for endgame which he should have been, so honestly what's the point."
"Remember at the beginning of the review I said that I didn't even see this movie in theaters. After more and more mixed to negative buzz around each new installment and the atrocity, no insult that was She-Hulk, I have given up on marvel. Especially when waiting for the movies I might care about to drop on disney plus is cheaper, I have retired from going to the thearter to see these movies. I don't want ot sound pretentious but a beating heart is the minimum a movie needs to have. It doesn't have to be a thought provoking or insightful look into the human condition. It can be a silly movie that takes you on a fun adventure or a movie that stirs your joy and even tells you something about yourself. I just to feel something when I watch a movie whether it's laughter or sadness and I just haven't felt that from these movies as of late. Hell, The Flash made me feel more emotion than anything coming out of marvel these days."
"This is the best MCU movie of 2023, Adam Warlock flying has been turned into an excellent meme and the soundtrack is perfect"
"While I haven't bothered to see most marvel stuff past endgame, I was willing to give this movie a shot and I'm really glad I did. The story of the Guardians feels like it properly ended on a bittersweet high note. Also the High Evolutionary is my personal favorite MCU villain he has the ""villain you love but also hate"" of Thanos, the ""I don't give a crap about anything"" of Hela and the ""I will do anything to enforce my beliefs whether people like it or not"" of killmonger. I'm sorry for rambling I just really liked how the High Evolutionary was portrayed by Chukwudi Iwiji."
More Marvel formula. No real joy.
Wow. What a send off. I enjoyed every minute of this film. The action sequence where they fight as a team is one of the best I've seen. The rest of the MCU should be taking notes.
The least funny of the three. Nice to see the back story of how Rocket was created. Didn‚Äôt feel the chemistry between the characters like it has been in the past. I didn‚Äôt like any of the music choices either. Weird bad guy and Gamora was insufferable and lame. MCU should just give up already.
A good movie but found I was a bit bored near the end and good story but not a very developed villain. Could have been better.
"Hard to believe that the same people who made the first two movies of the series wrote and made this movie. Had only a few scenes in the whole movie that were actually entertaining. For those critics who made excuses for the movie by saying it was about the deeper meaning of life (of a talking raccoon, none the less), I think you need to get a life! A shadow of it ‚Äòs former selves, and another movie that never needed to be made."
What a shame to end the series like that.

"It's a great superhero movie, with a good balance of action, comedy, and story. I, like I think many others, am currently feeling the ""superhero fatigue"" as so many superhero movies have been released it's hard to get excited about them, but the Guardians of the Galaxy series has been a ""breath of fresh air"" in the space. I hope they continue with the series and I would recommend watching this one!"

Pretty good movie and unexpected in its focus on rocket. It was still an odd continuation of Marvel's evolution to less fun movies.
This is a disappointing film but not suprising.
- The plot of Rocket was so overplayed.
- Nothing original
- The High Evolutionary desires  to get Rocket's brain as a commodity was really pathetic. Copy and paste from Infinity Wars?
- Creating a Eutopia ...again? Ctrl C + V from other story lines?
- Reusing tired jokes
- Limited script with alot of repetition
- Overstretched plot about resucing Rocket leaves it one-dimensional
- Shallow character development of Star-Lord as he just seems to quit
"- After 2hours 20 Min, I was bored and disappointed that they basically disbanded"
- Gamora returns? WTF?
"- In any fictional universe, there are rules and assumptions but this was highly insulting to force audiences to accept anything"
"- Costumes were like laughable, like candy teletubbies"
- Overuse of nostalgic music that didnt seem to fit
- Scenes were longer than necessary
"- The cameo of the Sovereign didnt really work well, it was weak that Warlock somehow became part of the 'family'  WTF"

However there is a good moral about friendship.
Perfect ending to a great trilogy.
"Muy divertida, emotiva, sorprendente y con un ritmo muy f√°cil de seguir."
"Amazing movie, better than the first two, the animal testing was hard to watch but made the movie better overall"
"The thing about this movie really, is that it combines 2 fantastic elements of film, which it hasn't done in previous movies. It takes outright comedy, and many aspects of drama."
"No matter what, you can expect to get a laugh out of this movie, and maybe a tear too."
"Almost perfect beside the ""I don't need no Man"" message that was clearly seeded in this movie."
"Funny, action-packed, sad, heartwarming‚Ä¶.loved it!"
A lot of nonsensical scenes. Only thing I enjoyed about the movie was more character development for Rocket. Certain other characters lacked development and certain actors had crappy lines.
"Loved every second of it,  it's perhaps even better than the first two. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"SPOILER WARNING! I've made it known before that I've grown very tired of the MCU in the past year but my one glimmer of hope was this movie and I'm happy to report that this movie sticks the landing is probably going to be the last good MCU movie for a while. It's not as good as Guardians 1 or 2 but still great. The story has some problems in that there are A LOT of characters which leaves it feeling maybe a little overstuffed but even with that issue it's still a great story. Rocket's backstory is incredibly emotional and everything dealing with him are easily the best parts of the movie. I do wish however that the film had made some more bold decisions though. The film has too many fake out deaths to the point where it was a little obnoxious and it felt somewhat cheap when they don't kill anyone by the end. Don't get me wrong I love that all these characters got their happy ending but I think one major death would have made this movie a lot more emotional and well rounded. That was my major issue with the film. I also don't think it looks quite as good as Volumes 1 and 2. The film looks great and so does the action but the other two installments look just a little better. Speaking of the action, it's really great here. Each action scene is really great and well choreographed especially the ""No Sleep from Brooklyn"" scene. The soundtrack is great as well. Not as good as the soundtracks for the other films but still really good with some great tracks on there. One of my favorite aspects of the film was definitely the villain. It's fun having a villain that's just straight evil. No redemption no nothing. He's just straight evil and Chukwudi Iwuji does a fantastic job in the role. He's definitely going over the top with it but I think that works extremely well for someone who has what is essentially a god complex. The rest of the cast does a great job as well especially Bradley Cooper as Rocket. As I mentioned earlier, Rocket's backstory is the best and most emotional part of the movie and Cooper does an incredible job at helping you to feel those emotions. The humor also works very well here too. There were so many jokes that worked for me. I think the DCU will be in mostly safe hands after watching this. I'd definitely recommend checking this out especially if you love the Guardians movies."
"Since Endgame the whole franchise was just nit the same. This movie made my short soaked wet from years for the last 30 minutes of it. Thanks, great soundtrack to a great story."
"Following the demise of Thanos, the MCU movies lack the punch they once had. On their own, without a thread connecting them, they seem weaker. I don't know if it is in the plans, but a reboot with foreshadowing of a common villain (perhaps Galactus?) could breathe new life into future releases."
3 hours of animal torture. A truly awful movie to watch.
"Amazing conclusion to the trilogy, heart wrenching, funny, and entertaining for the entire runtime. Better than endgame not going to lie."
"Still feels like a James Gunn movie, so someone in Disney failed to get him to toe the line.  Feels a bit long and starts off slow, but overall exactly what I expected and the best MCU film I have seen for a while"
"Was extremely grotesque, lots of weird animal mutations and one guy has face ripped off. Although I love the characters, I dislike the story, felt too uncomfortable for a heroes movie."
Had high anticipation but it really fell flat. The other Guardians movies were top notch but this just didn't have the same magic
"hermoso, magnifico uan peliucla que te ara llorar"
This was a great film to end a trilogy. All cast delivered their part perfectly and I love how each of them had their own chance to shine. James Gunn did a great job!
This is cinema!! Simples assim
Decent movie. Well made. Just not super exciting. Obviously a ton of money and effort went into it.
Great end for a great saga.
"(-) There's some intangible energy missing from the performances, especially Chris Pratt."
"(+) Long, sweet last gasp of a franchise."
Pretty decent ending to these films. Not as good as the first movie but better than the second movie.

"Do not take your children to this movie.  Nightmares will happen once  they see the ""animals""."
"Generic story, i can't believe RT going easy on this one"
Fitting ending to some of our favorite heroes.
"First of all there is no story. It has a really basic story that can written by a 6 yo kido... Costumes are beyond horrible. There is 0 action... Not even talking about effects, because there are no action scenes. They keep zoom in to faces, because they dont want to design background or costumes... Totally a disappointment..."
Storyline in not very interesting compared to vol 1 and 2.
Watched it because of the I liked the previous parts but unfortunately the story didn't do it for me. Felt is was shallow and had to be told very fast even though de length of the film was long.
It was entertaining but lacked the excitement of the 1st in the series.

Really nice surprice. Last time Marvel making really shitty movies and here is such a pearl. Just shame they done with Lylla and others so fast.  Worth to checking this movie. I think the best from all movies in this phase...
This movie done it's own thing no real tie in with the multiverse saga and basically a rocket orgin story
"Over use of music montages. Bad editing.  Cobbled together vignettes instead of a story. Upsetting animal cruelty which we know is fake (excellent visual effects work) but totally different emotions than previous films.  But interspersed with episodes of comedy that was so well done in previous ones, it's just bad and confusing."
I‚Äôm 20-25 mins into it and it‚Äôs a bit dark with zero humor. And not interesting.
"Great movie, best marvel movie since endgame. It was very funny and a perfect conclusion to the trilogy."
"I just rented the movie via streaming and it is the best in the series. Chris Pratt and the others were magical together. I laughed. I cried. The whole film is a feast to the eyes. üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I always know it's a good movie when I'm so engrossed that I forget where I am. That's what Guardians did for me. üßû More movies like this please, Marvel Studios!"
"I couldn't connect with it. It feels hollow, and poorly directed #Yawn"
"It was ok.  I loved Vol. 1&2.  Vol. 3 did not keep with the feel of 1&2.  If the music had stayed in line with 1&2, it would have made the movie so much better.  It was missing the humor that was so great in 1&2."
"Great fun but also touching with Rocket's story. Sure it's ""just"" a silly superhero/ costume/ sci-fi popcorn-movie, but I like such movies when they give enough to draw me in."
"I used to be sucker for most MCU movies, but in the past few years my interest had flagged. I decided to give this one a go, glad I did."
Despedida perfeita do James Gunn da franquia. Perfeito
James Gunn as well as the other writers and producers of this trilogy need their brains analyzed by scientists. I truly don't know how someone makes such a great movie series and doesn't fuck up a single one. Go watch all ther Gaurdians movies. Now.
"The beginnings of it was great, but it lost steam quick."
"The ending was quite meh, especially when this is their ""last"" movie."
It's becoming frustrating how Disney is playing every marvel movie so‚Ä¶.. safe.
Great top 3 all time marvel movie for sure
"The plot seemed ramshackle and completely random, with weak propulsive force and thin strings of blandness connecting awkward set-pieces consisting of one-liners or CGI explosions. The heart of this movie - Rocket's origin story - was so emotionally overdone that it ended up feeling like a cynical corporate attempt at jerking your heartstrings. I loved the soundtrack, but that's about all I loved about this movie. As a huge fan of the first Guardians movie, I was sad to see the franchise played off the stage this way."
Maybe the most mature and well-written MCU movie ever.

"This movies has everything good you can imagine in a Marvel movie! Exciting action, beautiful visuals, fantastic humor, but above all that a story so profoundly emotional I think it's the best in all Marvel movies on that front! Must watch."

¬°PINCHE PEL√çCULA HERMOSA!
This the top 10 best movie of 2023 I love this movie so much that I had a idea to make a movie called Guardians of the sharks ü¶à
This is exactly how you end a trilogy. This is by far my favorite GotG film and it was full of emotions both good and bad. Also was great to see how every character seemed to be put in the spotlight.
It's a good plot with good character even better ending
"Mostly satisfying conclusion to the Guardians story. Not as tight as the first two movies..  The long run time did not help as it highlighted the inconsistencies and low points during the storytelling. Some of the ""comedy"" seemed out of place and some music placement felt like overkill. Still great song choices but didn't always fit strongly with the scene. Visually excellent and the corridor fight scene warranted an immediate re-watch. Incredibly shot & choreographed."
""
Spider-Man:No Way Home is at the top of a mostly disappointing Marvel MCU Phase 4.  Guardians Vol.3 comes in second edging out Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.  But the rest are poor.  Disney/Marvel has over-saturated the MCU with too frequent mediocre content full of weak writing & stories.
Very amazing story for Rocket and showing how he's evolved as a character in the MCU.
"This film is wildly emotional, suspensful, exciting and hilarious all at the same time. You will laugh and you will cry in this action packed thrill ride of emotions."
"Muito bom , melhor filme da Marvel 2023"
The end of the guardians of the galaxy it's epic but the movie it's still very good.
Great family movie. This movie has a lot of heart and soul.
"I enjoyed it. of course they neutered strong male characters a little, but over all it was a decent story and worth a watch."
"While the first movie started with an exciting opening and ending, this starts and ends with tearfull eyes"
"better then the first one, and the first one was good"
"It is a film that leaves a beautiful message about animal abuse, something that teaches us to reflect and pay more attention to this problem that still exists."
"In my opinion the Guardians trilogy is the best in the MCU. I absolutely love this movie and it's heartbreaking yet fun story. Unfortunately it's not perfect. The big problem I had is the two tones the movie had. At one minute I found myself on the verge of tears and the next I was laughing hysterically. I'm not saying a movie has to be one tone the entire time but there was no worrying between shifts. Something super sad and impactful would happen then, not even a minute later, it would be back to the funny jokes and bright colors that you expect from a Guardians movie. This movie is a great time and I love a lot about. Just be prepared for some emotional whiplash"
"Saw the 94% rotten tomato score and was not disappointed. I regret not seeing it in theaters, I think I'm going to watch it again."
"I have enjoyed all the movies in this series and this was no exception. It had everything I wanted in a Guardians movie. If this was the last one they make, it was a fine ending."
The back story on rocket was great it would be great if we could get back stories on the rest of the characters
"Favorite Guardians movie, and one of the best Marvel has put out period. Definitely one of the few shining moments in Phase 4."
"Great ending to the trilogy, lots of emotion, laughs, and excitement. Was definitely my favorite out of the three."
Unoriginal plot and painfully boring to watch.
"Providing diverting action and heartwarming storytelling, the Guardians third solo round-up negatively undermines the villain and lacks some briskness during its middle portion. but it is still an amusing, involving and fuilfilling conclusion to this trilogy with a high emphasis on character depth."
"the movie is best because rocket backstory was so emotional, cgi and vfx was beautiful, the high evolutionary was a menace and its the best movie of 2023 i give 10/10"
"It wasn't quite the powerhouse that the first or second one was... but then again those movies are perfection. This one had some really good moments and especially looked into the past of the character Rocket which was very interesting. A lot of flashbacks gives a perspective and understanding of why Rocket behaves as he does. Also his ""medical emergency"" is an opportunity to involve the whole cast. A polarizing point. It was nice to see the old characters again and how they've evolved. And that's the key to a successful franchise, we care about the characters. The plot and flow of this anticipated sequel could be better. I hope there is a 4th, I'll watch it to see what is ongoing for characters we all care about."

"Interesting movie, want to watch it a second time"
"Good movie, very good, I like it very much, recommend it to more people"
There's a serious amount of animal cruelty in this movie. And watching them torture and kill them made me nauseous.

"Unexpectedly dark in its opening, off and on throughout, and ascending from the midway point.  While it takes a bit to reorient after their last outing with the other Marvel heroes, the movie soon takes off. The humor and camaraderie build leaving one with a sense that the universe is in good hands, although decidely hands moving in mostly different directions."
"An utterly pointless journey literally from nowhere (or KnowWhere) , few redeeming features, terrible script, and an over reliance on things blowing up and an overpowered ""bad guy"" with a fatal weakness.  Perhaps it is time to quit making sequels if there's nothing of value to story up."
It was really funny butt complete trash they destroyed the movie
Absolutely the best!
"I was so close to crying throughout this movie and I hate myself because I didn't cry, especially at 2 or 3 certain scenes. What an Ending. To a Trilogy. To an Era. James Gunn you did it, you incredible son of a bitch you are a genius. Did I expect to love this movie, absolutely, but did I expect to rank it so high on my MCU list, nope, I figured hopefully Top 5, but the fact that it is taken 2nd place is incredible. I saw this with my friends, Mitch, Joel and Braydon and we had the best time, this was just an experience, to the point where we were all clapping after the final post-credit scene, the audience was applauding, and it was well deserved. You could see the difficulty for the cast in this movie as this would've been a very emotional ride to make this masterpiece. Every character gets beautiful moments, Top Tier performances. The High Evolutionary and Adam Warlock were incredible villains. Here is the biggest positive for me which all other MCU films have recently been failing, balancing humor and heavy emotions, James Gunn did it perfectly, he knew when it was ok to make a joke. This was just to good to be true and yet it is. I love this movie, I love everything about it, I'll never forget the experience in the theatre. Guys this is a must see, it will give you hope that Marvel can come back again after their mess. Thank You James Gunn, this trilogy means everything to me, you have no idea how much the Guardians impacted me."
"Seems as if Disney is making films for kids and while many are eye catching, that's all it is; this 3rd GOTG film is no different."
Needs a trigger warning for animal cruelty.
"I enjoyed the movie overall, but i felt like the music aspect was a bit overused in this one. the scenes with rocket's past were also very heartbreaking and it was disturbing to see dead tortured/experimented on animals so blatantly on screen as well as the genocide of the people on counter-earth. this is arguably one of the darkest marvel movies currently out. i still liked the movie but those parts were hard to sit through. i loved that we got to see drax being himself, and an emotional side to nebula we haven't previously seen. i've always adored her character and her arcs she's had, but this movie especially got to me as a nebula fan."
"Easily the worst GoG movie ever made.  For example, Starlord is a depressed drunk, and even his attempts to be funny are horrible.  I don't know who pick the soundtrack, but it went from 70's classic rock, to alternative whatever that no one has ever heard of.  Draxx is the only character that has any resemblance to the quirky joyful renegade crew of old, and even his lines are boring, including far more complaining about Mantis.  I loved the first GoG, really enjoyed the second, . . . and I wish I hadn't wasted my time on the third.  What on earth is Disney doing to films."
"It was the best film. Excellent plot, extremely moving and a fitting goodbye."
Sense I watch The Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 and maybe I could watch them I mean the first one is pretty cool and the second one was so divine and cool visuals and the third one 10 out of 10 I mean a dog with telekinesis it was a bomb!
What a movie. The vibe was so different from the first 2 which comes with a great risk but James Gunn nailed it perfectly. And the choice of music was impeccable as always.
"It was disgusting to watch. I expected the usual humor, adventure and simply fun. And it was animal cruelty porn show with gore. And quite boring compared to previous movies from that series."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is by far the best superhero film Marvel has put out in a while. I‚Äôm going to be honest I am Not a fan of how marvel is trying to connect all of there films and shows together because it just leaves people who haven‚Äôt seen one of the films very confused. Well in this case this movie doesn‚Äôt get affected by that as it doesn‚Äôt require you to have seen any of the other films or shows. Of course seeing the previous films would get you more connected with the characters and their stories, however this film is just as entertaining going into it without the knowledge of the characters as they are very likable and you connect with them very quickly. This film mainly focuses on Rocket‚Äôs tragic past and it really shows how rocket was mistreated throughout his youth. For me this is a really good movie that really gets the viewers invested. I do recommend this film to fans of superhero films."

Absolutely fantastic
"I cried a lot, but I think it's just me"
"Conclus√£o de trilogia perfeita, destacando o Rocket e sua sofrida hist√≥ria. Gunn deu a essa franquia sua cara, e que conseguiu se conectar at√© ao p√∫blico que n√£o √© f√£ da Marvel. Sobre o filme, trilha sonora perfeita, al√≠vios c√¥micos no tempo certo e drama na dose exata, atua√ß√µes e entrosamento do elenco impec√°veis. Dos novos personagens, destaque ao Alto Evolucion√°rio."
An fun emotional and beautiful send off for the Guardians of the Galaxy and reminds you of the old mcu.
"Gunn dimostra anche con il terzo capitolo di guardiani della galassia si saper regalare i migliori film del MCU. Film veramente divertente e allo stesso tempo commovente e coinvolgente, i cambi di registro sono fatti bene e permettono allo spettatore di godersi entrambe i lati del film. Effetti speciali e colonna sonora sono impeccabili, e sono una cornice perfetta alle scene d'azione girate e coreografate molto bene."
"Being a fan of the Guardians, I was excited to see Vol.3...however, it was too extreme for me. The violence and animal abuse/experimentation was just too much. It made my heart hurt. I do not recommend this movie for kids or animal lovers or anyone else that has violence fatigue - from movies, media, or real life."
"An overall enjoyable movie, that suffers only as a result of its director. James Gunn's writing, especially when it comes to the comedy & jokes, are tired, played out and predictable."
Bring the tissues this one‚Äôs a tearful while also very funny
The Guardians lost the magic they had in the first 2 movies (especially the original movie). I found the constant conflict between the main characters over the top. The storyline and CG was ok. Definitely not my favorite MCU movie.
I don't often leave reviews but this movie is SO so disturbing! Animal cruelty! Do not watch and show to children or any animal lovers at all!
""
"I hate the scenes with young Rocket and his friends - they are cruel, sad, inhumane and utterly disturbing! The movie may have some good moments but it genuinely pains me to watch some of the scenes and this ruined it for me!"
"Just alright, thin story"
Fun farewell from friends and a good reminder of great friendships.
"Decent marvel movie ? Yes. One of the best ? I‚Äôm not sure about that, it‚Äôs just better than the recent garbage put out. Animal cruelty? Definitely none in this movie, not any more than human cruelty."
"Awesome Graphics, Emotions, Drama, Action all in one superbb !!"
Gross. Another lame Christian allegory posing as sci-fi.
""
"Good effects. Good soundtrack. Trite tale of naughty stand-in for Yahweh trying to perfect creation by focusing on the physical and, of course, failing. There's even a near-death experience scene which plays like one of those evangelical tell all books about what heaven is really like and are sold next to the Enquirer at check-out."
Amazing movie sow fanny and sad at the same timeü•≤ü•≤
"Not as good as the first two movies, as not all the humour hits, and it is missing the efficiency of its predecessors. Nonetheless, it is a fun time."
"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 is magnificent and profound. It has so many uplifting messages, exploring deep themes such as suffering, trauma, healing, loss, the meaning and value of life, character growth, innocence in the face of evil, fighting for loved ones, animal welfare, protecting children and the vulnerable, transhumanism, the inevitability of change and the importance of family and friendship."
""
"Rocket Raccoon's story finds its completion and it is utterly beautiful, relatable and consoling. It helped me find renewed meaning in life in spite of the presence of suffering. It made me feel in such a way as I have not felt before. Rocket is a beautifully written character."
""
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and easily makes my top ten favourites! Wow! What a story!!! The trilogy has been concluded perfectly. They truly nailed it with this one! Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotive masterpiece. A work of art. I will not forget the experience of watching it.

Guardi√£es da Gal√°xia √© a prova em que filmes de Her√≥is podem sim ser bons. James Gunn faz com que o expectador n√£o perca o foco do filme em nenhum segundo. Um filme excelente.
Unsatisfying conclusion
Most heartfelt of the trio. Grand send off of all the characters which leaves the series with a multitude of ways to head into the future.
Yep
.......

"Stopped watching 1/3 of the way through because I couldn't handle another second of the characters yelling almost every line to make it seem like there was some kind of suspenseful situation. The writing was terrible, the acting was bad, the visual fx and costumes looked ridiculous, why is a villain a white guy in a spirit halloween fat suit along with an alien in a fat suit? They screwed with some classic rock songs to make them sound more feminine. Of course because its disney they had to check the boxes of including gay and lesbian scenes but forgot to check the box of making a good movie. The jokes were dumb. I couldn't care less how this movie ends, watching this movie was comparable to listening to nails on a chalkboard. After so much yelling of every line and bad acting it was time to shut it down!"
I really liked how it showed 2 different stories present and past to bring alive a character. The humor and the heart keep you buzzed all the way through without the characters being too soft because they're blazing a trail right through their enemies. One of my favorites of 2023 (on a short list).
Too much baby animal mutilation/abuse for me. Not recommended for children. Also not as funny and enjoyable as the first two volumes.
Total let down. The hole film felt massively forced and thrown together
"This vol 3 is so emotional and in the same time funny. Gotta say, one of the best Marvel movies in a while. Hope to see the crew back again soon."
The best one in the trilogy. Rocket Raccoon‚Äôs origin story is a beautiful tragedy.
Never cried harder in a movie theater than I have with this movie
Very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
amazing movie! I love how they kept the humor that has been present throughout the Guardians trilogy while also showing a dark past. definitely a must see.
"With a dramatic turn and the right amount of humour, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 makes a memorable farewell for MCU's loveable family"
Amazing graphic design. Love the passion of the developers. All love. Thanks Marvel
"Overall a lovable, adorable, goofy,awkward, heartfealt,family, team fantasy space comedy adventure."

"This director Killed Guardians Of The Galaxy franchise,  with his obsession of Rocket. He actually made an entire back story of Rocket, as A sequel movie. And was boring as Hell... gosh, the obsession...oh well, goodbye. Now you know, NOBODY, was as obsessed with the freaking Racoon,  as you were... thx for kill, a promising,  franchise..."
"I didn't see the guardians II, but after seeing this one I want to....this one pushes all the right buttons..."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic ending to the best trilogy in the MCU.
"James Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy trilogy officially rests with satisfaction, dark edgyness, Love, and a sycopathic villain"
"Overlong, too violent, too gross with a lot of disturbing imagery for younger viewers, such as mutilated animal characters and many onscreen killings. At time i was reminded the intensity and violence in Watchmen."
"We, as a society, need to stop watching MCU stuff. I mean, if you still enjoy it, all the power to you, but generally speaking I am of an opinion that we had given Marvel far too much at this point, with diminishing returns. From the perspective of those four years I am confident to say that ""Endgame"" was a turning point in history of the modern superhero formula, or even the summer blockbuster itself. Now, a lot of it can also be attributed to how it preceded the shitshow that was 2020, but that's another story altogether. My point is, MCU is now nothing like what it used to be and we (again: as a society) need to finally acknowledge it."
"...that being said, the third installment of the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rocks hard. James Gunn and his creative crew somehow managed to invoke the spirit of the of MCU in this movie; they stopped the hands of the clock and made them to go backward to the whereabouts of 2014, and that was forever ago. The story of Rocket is an emotional tearjerker, but done tastefully and with visual panache rarely seen in Marvel these days. And even the villain, which lately I consider one of the worst elements of modern MCU movies, is on point ‚Äì the High Evolutionary is a character everyone will love to hate. Is there anything more to ask for?"
"This right here might be the last really good movie of this franchise. I would love to be proved wrong, but right now I just cannot muster the hype that we all felt five to ten years ago."
James Gunn never fails to bring never before seen ideas into movies to keep them fresh. Truly spectacular costume design as well.
"This third installment was what it should have been from the beginning. A franchise outside the MCU and aimed at children / adolescents, despite the fact that it has some somewhat ""cruel"" scenes. I also believe that today's children would not be affected."
Entertaining and emotional.
It's pretty good by today's action movie standards
"It was the worst - way too dark, morbid and depressing. And how they tell Rocket's story‚Ä¶ what a way to take the series behind your house and Old Yeller it. And then the f-bomb. Where am I and why did I spend this time watching this movie? Hard pass for anyone who loved the first two. This totally killed it for me. RIP GotG. You were great, once."
This movie was upsetting from start to finish.
Probably the best Marvel Movie to date. They had a whole fight scene that was filmed in one shot!
Not as good as the first one but close. Well acted and written.
"While definetly heavier in tone than the previous entries, the third film offers some real development and a satisfying conclusion for each of the heroes. It's refreshing to have a movie in the Marvel universe that actually resolves. An excellent exit for James Gunn."
"Doesn't hold up to its predecessors. Lack of a super awesome mixtape. Feels mostly silly instead of creatively comedic. Chris Pratt saying the F-word does not make him ""look cool."" The writers must have been on a bad trip with this one."
Much better than I expected. The ending was great. Warlock stunk. Some parts seemed lazy but overall the best movie marvel has done in a while.
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is not the best movie about the intergalactic team of heroes, but it's a good film that will work for fans of Guardians of the Galaxy. It doesn't feel connected to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in any big way, outside of a few references from previous movies. That will definitely be disappointing to fans of the MCU, especially since the movie tries to present itself as an ending of sorts for this team. But if you just go along for the ride, you'll be able to enjoy this last ride with this team for the Guardians of the Galaxy. It may not be as dramatic of an ending as we hoped, but not everything needs to end in a grim way to be good, sometimes things just come to an end in a more chill way. Whether that makes it a great conclusion or not will be different for everyone."
Best marvel movie in years!
"Not as good as the previous two. It is impressive how Gunn was able to complete his trilogy in a satisfying way. I say this because there is a gap of the story in between Volume 2 and 3, which takes place in the avengers movies, that is definitely felt throughout the movie. However, Its not as jarring as I expected it be and I think Gunn handled it the best way that he could. I really doubt he planned on having Gamora die in a non-guardians movie."
This movie was fantastic. The sadness was balanced by the laughter- an emotional roller coaster. But it didn't quite feel like a guardians movie. There's something missing. But i don't know what.
"Good movie, very enjoyable. It somehow made me cry over a raccoon. The only thing that would have made it better was if Gamora just stayed dead."
Movie was OK.  It had some fun moments but overall not as good as Vol. 1 or Vol. 2.
"Funny, emotional, and one hell of a mic drop from James Gunn. Provides a much-anticipated explanation of Rocket's backstory while providing closure to many of the characters' relationships introduced in earlier MCU films. The dark tone of Rocket's history added a level of seriousness that has been absent from the other Stage 4 MCU films."
I cried. I laugh and I laugh while I cried. I recommend to watch 3 times. Let's do it.
From vol 1  always improved.  Vol3 is amaizimg movie. Good ending.
