Review
"I wanted badly to like it, but alass, it was terrible."
"It's such a boring movie to watch, and the acting was really bad too. They just put a bunch of famous actors in the movie to add some hype but there's literally zero correlation. I only watched it because it's in the MCU watch order. It took me a whole week to finish it because I kept pausing it because of how boring it is...."
"Eternals, an ambitious superhero epic, takes the MCU in intriguing yet confusing directions."
"It has so much potential. I feel like if they had given more time into the writing and plot it would've been really good but the fact that they have one extremely strong Eternal (Icarus) and the rest were somewhat strong is dumb. Plus, Sersi being so clueless is annoying, she really needed it spelt put for her why she was chosen? She constantly needs someone to baby information to her before it clicks."
""
Favourite part - Sprite getting knocked out by Druig.
Second favourite part - Ikaris getting got.
It‚Äôs not the best movie
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am eagerly hoping for a sequel. The film excelled in both character development and action sequences, creating a compelling and engaging experience. I was surprised to see some reviews from people who didn't finish it. To truly appreciate the film's strengths and offer a fair assessment, it's essential to watch it in its entirety."
ETERNALS IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN THE MCU. THE MOVIE WAS ALMOST FLAWLESS! I HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THE ETERNALS IN THE MCU.
"Contrary to what professional reviewers say, it is not in fact the first MCU project to rewrite the comics or distance itself from it. Eternals is good movie on its own, and has the merit of offering one of the most beautiful and peaceful endings of MCU movies."
We need a second eternals.
"Ignore the critics, this is a great movie!"
"So finally, getting to see this and for this being a mixed bag or just plain bad as some would say, this is below average to me.  A mixed bag in so many ways.  Let's just say that its concept is interesting, yet there is so much to process, and this film just takes way too long as it is two and a half hours.  To be fair, the Eternals are the ones watching over humanity while they evolve, and you could say that they're witnessing on how we, humanity, progresses as they interact rather than interfering with our conflict."
"You could make the argument that the CG effects aren't that impressive, but I've seen worse while also admitting that this isn't the best effect either.  It's interesting while the designs are unique for something based on the comic book series back in the 70s, apparently.  Maybe I might understand a little more if I see this again once or twice more, but for the length of it, it might not be the case."
"I'm mixed with the acting as it ranges from okay to pretty dull.  Kingo, Phastos, Makkari, and even Sersi were great.  Thena, Ikaris and Ajak were fine.  Druig and Sprite do get on my nerves, sadly.  Same for the writing.  The plot is all over the place, while the dialogue was also much of a mixed bag.  However, it does make up for some character development as time goes by."
"Not to mention, the cinematography isn't the best looking, but you have to admit some of the powers make up for it.  Especially Makkari being a speedster which has to be the best lookin' in live-action, in my honest opinion.  The conflict between the Eternals and the Deviants is average, and the conversation with the Celestial itself is as much as what we'd look for when you'd like to talk to Galactus.  I say that before Fantastic Four: The First Steps, as I'm writing this review."
"Overall, I did get bored by this film.  It was more or less showing more than telling, as far as this movie goes.  If I have to be honest, it might've been better as a series, given a better budget and a script to explain the situation better, if you ask me.  I give this film five Arishem communicating out of ten.  5/10."
"Although Marvel has made excellent movies out of their B and C characters, making a movie using Jack Kirby's overly complicated Sci-Fi universe might not have been Marvel's best move."
77% audiences love it? Really???
Gemma Chan was good in this film and the Visuals were impressive but bad writing and messy story hurt the film alot
It‚Äôs the worst thing a movie can be‚Ä¶ boring!
"An MCU movie that doesn't feel like an MCU movie. It feels more like a fantasy movie than superhero. I'd never read a single Eternals comic before seeing the movie, though I've perused a few since then, but they didn't pull me in.  So in that respect, I was hoping for a Guardians of the Galaxy type surprise (another movie where I knew nothing about the comic), but it isn't nearly at that level. That's mostly because the characters aren't as interesting and the laughs and witty banter is missing."
""
"In retrospect, I enjoyed most of the characters and their glaring faults. Based on how they were created, you'd think they would be near perfect, but not so. That's a good thing, because it's the only truly interesting thing about the movie besides the ending end-credit scene with promises of things to come."
""
"Jump a few years into the future and we finally see a nod to Enternals in Brave New World. I thought they would brush Enternals under the rug, but thankfully they didn't.  I've heard they scrapped any plans regarding the new heros in the end credit scene, which is very disappointing.  Dare to hope."
WORST MARVEL MOVIE IN HISTORY!
"One of my least favorite marvel films. When I first saw it in theaters I actually forgot my glasses, so I couldn‚Äôt really even see anything, I came out thinking it was pretty good. But once rewatching it on Disney plus I started to see all its flaws, ones I couldn‚Äôt see probably because of my glasses. A solid 2/10 for me, maybe worth a watch once, but then never again."
Don‚Äôt know why this movie gets all that hate. It deserved a sequel.
I like the story that they are trying to tell but I feel like they didn't have enough time to tell it one movie without affecting the pacing.  It is beautiful though.
I got 40 minutes in before I bailed. Now it is stuck in ‚Äúcurrently watching‚Äù limbo on my Disney+ and I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of it. Which makes me hate this movie even more. I know I could fast forward through the whole movie to make it leave the queue but I don‚Äôt want Disney to think I actually watched this awful mess of a movie so I‚Äôm just waiting until I die I guess.
"sus graficos son lo mejor de la pel√≠cula su historia es entretenida, no todos los personajes encajan pero la recomiendo"
"Such a waste of good characters, talented actors and long comics history and plots that were utterly ignored."
"This was a solid addition to the MCU and, bought some interesting characters to the screen... Who I am sure we will see again"
"Great potential and a solid story but dodgy execution. A Bollywood dance number was not necessary, nor was the 40% of the film that half-heartedly followed character drama."
Longest 2 and a half hours of my life. This movie also did not connect to marvel in the slightest way.
One of the worst marvel movies ever do not reccomend it only reason to watch it is to watch captain america brave new world for the celestial
"The Eternals grows on you. I enjoyed the first watch in the theatre. On my second watch, it really gelled, and I wish there was a sequel."
"Stunning visuals. Old overused storytelling tropes , forgettable characters and a movie that shouldn't have been made"
Underrated movie! The only part I didn't really like was the romance between the human dude and the eternal. It felt kind of forced and there wasn't much chemistry. Considering how many characters there were they did a good job of balancing them. The action sequences and effects are among the very best.
I actually liked it. I know others didn't care for it üôÉ
This should‚Äôve been a 10 or 12 episodes of limited series. Introducing so many new characters in such a short film plus enemy not a good idea
Was a great MCU version of the Eternals. If you didn't like it you just don't like Marvels Eternals period.
"The plot is good but, the movie is way overstuffed with characters that do not even feal like they have there own personalities or are very basic, which stinks because this movie had the potential to be great."
"Loved it on first watch in theater, and even more when my second viewing allowed me to catch some of the deeper philosophy embedded in the epic story. There have been pure action, sci-fi, comedic, sorcery, and now we get an artistic film that, if not tied to Marvel, is the type of film that could be up for an Academy Award."
"An element of the standard comic book movie viewing audience didn‚Äôt care for it, but I suggest they weren‚Äôt prepared for it, and with different expectations, any fan could enjoy a rewatch."
"Think of this film concept in the way we see immortal stories like Highlander or vampires, who struggle with outliving the mortals they connect with, and try to find meaning in their long lives. We add super powers to that story, and get the complexity of Eternals."
This is what a superhero fighting sequence should look like! Awesome
This was horrible trash! How is it rated so high?!!!
I truly enjoyed this movie.  I found it more mature and interesting then most of Marvels typical weightless movies.   The story was well thought out and I loved the turmoil and twists the movie gave us.
About 5 million times better than the Marvels.
"Pretty disappointing. I thought this was going to be a great movie coming right off the heels of Endgame. They threw a whole bunch at it, and the movie fell way short."
Can't digest how bad the movie was. Bad movies still gets someone who will like them and this was one of those. Can't recommend this movie to anyone. Will be hard to digest the fact that I was sitting in the theatre the entire duration.
"Loved this movie, underappreciated. Eternals deserves a sequel."
Impeccable effects and plot. The screenwriter knew what he was doing when he put in these exceptional action scenes.
Terrible story and terrible cgi
Loved it so damn much!!!
"It's crazy that so close on the heels of one of the most incredible marvel sagas of all time we get a movie so disconnected from the rest of the MCU continuity.  they reference the blip, but they don't do anything with that knowledge.  The whole movie feels like they could have just as easily set in on different earth,  or been better served making a TV series where could have really explored and gotten to know these characters.  The script never seems to know where it wants to go or wants to do. It doesn't really fit with the MCU and nothing that it does seems to have any lasting significance even with its LITERALLY earth shattering conclusion.  This really could have been amazing if they had made a series or taken more time to bake and polish the script and really drill down to who each character is and what they bring to the table.  Casting is all over the place too. some are great, some are not, and some are just forgettable. I've watched it more than once and each time it just seems disappoint me even more, because I can see all the potential that COULD have been there and it just seems like such a waste.  unless you absolutely have to see everything marvel, skip this. Aside from a throw away reference in She-hulk, its never brought up again."
"Eternals could be a lot of fun, but it's too long and there are illogical character decisions."
""
"The writing is mixed. On the one hand I like the characters. I think they are well established and most of them are either likeable or understandable. My favourite character is Kingo. I love what he became and what he chose to do in the end. I also liked Sersi, Gilgames and Makkari. Druig made some very illogical decisions and he seemed like to different characters at times. I love when mythological figures become Marvel characters. The dialogues are sometimes well-written and well-earned, but sometimes very clich√©d. The story is a little messy with the huge amount of time jumps, but I liked it. I liked the twists at the end and the second post credit scene makes me anxious to get to know more."
""
"The cinematography is not what critics would recognize, but I love how this movie is shot. The visual effects are gorgeous. The editing isn't that good. The storyline in the past is given so that the audience would gain knowledge of something that has happened before or would happen soon. I think that was not consistent and there were too many timelines. I think this could've worked more as a television series."
""
"Eternals is more enjoyable for me than most, because I loved some of the characters, the story was cool and I love the cinematography."
this movie freaking blows. great for taking a nap
0 would be too generous for this garbage
Sucks; makes no sense; I dummmer for watching it
"This felt like Chat GPT tried to make a Marvel movie. It‚Äôs nothing interesting, and the characters aren‚Äôt memorable AT ALL!!! Lame and not worth it."
"The best marvel film ever made. All marvel/disney films have been disappointing and for a long time. This, however, massively bucked that trend. 100% a must watch."
"Great cast, love seeing Game of Thrones actors moving on in other stuff. Great visual effects, a deaf super hero and a team as diverse as a rainbow, what is there not to like."
This is a very good movie with such good characters.
"Marvel once again captivates audiences with stunning visual effects and a layered, intricate storyline that hints at a grander, often subtle narrative beneath the surface. The MCU continues to explore the enduring theme of humanity‚Äôs worth, emphasizing that the greater good will triumph. Through the actions and sacrifices of the main characters, the film underscores the belief that humanity is worth saving, even at a significant personal cost."
"A rare miss from Marvel.  Not many redeeming qualities in the character, dialogue or special effects.  Run time was too long and story was uninteresting.   First ‚Äúbad‚Äù Marcel movie I‚Äôve seen and our family is going through every one in chronological order."
"I do not think that Eternals is a bad movie, just a bland movie that tried to do something brand new in the superhero genre. The movie has some great moments and it does some things EXTREMELY well, but the things they do not seem to be very prevalent in the film. The movie boasts an all-star cast who are amazing actors, but the writing and the pacing just felt like it could have been tweaked just a bit more. The emotional moments did not feel earned and there was a character whose death just seemed like they were trying to thin the herd. The movie‚Äôs biggest problem was thinking way too big with what they wanted to do with it, when they should have been more focused on one thing in this film rather than many. It was not bad, but it is a disappointing movie."
I just waste a 157 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie
The action scenes are really good but everything else is horrible
This is very good. The criticism that is receives is very harsh. It is a superhero film about beings from far off universes. The story is good progresses very well for the amount of character each get introduced very very then reintroduced with the passage of time from the ancient past to the present.
""
Being released in 2021 didn't do the box office sales much favours with the pandemic still affecting the world and confidence in being in enclosed spaces with large volumes of people.
""
It would be great to get a second film of Eternals but Marvel studios have done very little to acknowledge the outcome of this in other parts of the marvel story.
"Underrated Marvel movie. Great casting, breaks out from the regular Marvel movie formula, cool story with grand scope. I think it deserves a second look from people that maybe didn't enjoy it so much the first time."
"N√£o √© horr√≠vel, mas √© meio sem alma, falta sal."
I love the Eternals. It feels different from the rest of Marvel movies.
Interesting characters and fun scenes. The overall plot is weak and the final act had very little tension to it. Women are over sold as Strong - but that's common with the flipping of the script in the last few years.
""
I enjoyed the references to Galactus and Titans in general. It was a very different type of movie - decidedly sci-fi for a Marvel movie. It'll be interesting how they tie this into more 'normal' MCU films.
Awesome movie üëçüëçüëçüëç
"One of the most boring dragged out slop of a movie, couldn't care less about the characters and there are way to many to get involved with, overall I fell asleep at the theaters and hated every second of this film Eternals and argyle were the absolute worst movies of this year."
"I think this is the worse Marvel film so far. The basic premise of the movie - if I understand it - makes no sense whatsoever. The movie is too confusing, especially when trying to keep track of what is past and what is present. There are too many ""superheroes"" to keep track of and some of them are NOT good people. Aren't superheroes supposed to be basically good and working with each other to accomplish good? Not these. The term ""Eternals"" to me means everlasting but some of them were not, although some of them seemed to come back from the dead!?! I don't know. There was too much reliance on special effects and CGI used over and over again. CGI should help telling the story, not be the story."
"Os efeitos especiais est√£o perfeitos, gostei bastante dos personagens tamb√©m , porem achei o filme muito longo com uma hist√≥ria chata."
Assisti mesmo por ser f√£ da Marvel e do universo.
"The Eternals are a band of thoroughly unlikable characters. With so many characters in the main cast it can be difficult to keep track of which one is which. But eventually I'm satisfied with remembering their names, vaguely defined powers and if I'm lucky their one-note character drama."
""
"As I go through each member of the team I find myself hating each one. Ikaris: egotistical jerk. Sprite: annoying brat who has the power to make illusions but can't figure out how to make herself look older. Phastos: Always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Makkari: Doesn't have a whole lot to do, but could solve all the problems if she just used her powers. Druig: Jerky emo guy who thinks he's better than everyone. Thena: Will randomly flip out and start attacking everyone."
""
"Although the visuals are good, I couldn't help but notice that the aspect ratio of the movie kept rapidly changing throughout the film. It was very distracting. The action isn't helmed all that well. It is hard when dealing with super beings that hardly anything can hurt, to make an action scene that is compelling. But at least make an action scene where I can see what is going on."
""
"Towards the climax of the film, one of the characters just decides not to participate in the final showdown. Honestly I should have taken my que from him and just bailed on this movie part way through. The finale is your typical Marvel CGI fest with no concrete weight or stakes."
""
"As far as the positive goes, It seems to be trying to tell a strange new story with compelling ideas. It just fails to do so."
""
The main characters are pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone . And the fans of this movie come across as pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone.
At the end of the was nothing but CGi was ü§§
"Eternals, Marvel‚Äôs ambitious foray into cosmic storytelling, is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that unfortunately stumbles in its execution. While it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in its willingness to tackle grand ideas about humanity, purpose, and the nature of heroism, it struggles to balance its ensemble cast and deliver the emotional depth it promises."
""
"One of the film‚Äôs greatest assets is its scope. Directed by Chlo√© Zhao, Eternals is visually spectacular, with sweeping landscapes, celestial visuals, and a sense of scale that feels unique within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Zhao‚Äôs signature style‚Äîgrounded, naturalistic cinematography‚Äîadds a layer of realism to this otherwise otherworldly story. The score, too, is evocative, adding weight to pivotal moments."
""
"However, where the film falters is in its storytelling. With so many characters and millennia-spanning history to unpack, the narrative feels overstuffed and uneven. The central conflict, involving the emergence of a Celestial and the group‚Äôs fractured loyalties, has potential but often takes a backseat to exposition-heavy dialogue and flashbacks. The result is a story that feels slow at times and rushed at others."
""
"The cast, while talented, is unevenly utilised, with some characters getting far more development than others. Angelina Jolie‚Äôs portrayal of Thena is a prime example of this imbalance. Jolie is captivating in every scene she‚Äôs in, bringing a regal intensity and vulnerability to her role as the troubled warrior. Her struggles with Mahd Wy‚Äôry (her deteriorating mental state) are intriguing and deeply emotional, yet she feels sidelined for much of the film. Given her star power and the depth she could bring to the character, it‚Äôs disappointing that Thena isn‚Äôt given more focus. Her relationship with Gilgamesh is one of the film‚Äôs most touching aspects, but it leaves you wanting more."
""
"The rest of the ensemble shines in moments but feels constrained by the film‚Äôs attempt to juggle so many arcs. Gemma Chan‚Äôs Sersi anchors the story with grace, while Richard Madden‚Äôs Ikaris brings complexity to his role as the morally torn Eternal. Kumail Nanjiani‚Äôs Kingo provides much-needed humour, though his sudden disappearance during the climax feels jarring. Brian Tyree Henry‚Äôs Phastos and Lauren Ridloff‚Äôs Makkari offer refreshing representation and standout moments but are underutilised in the broader narrative."
""
"Thematically, Eternals deserves credit for asking big questions about the cost of free will, the purpose of creation, and what it means to be human. These are heavy, ambitious ideas that set the film apart from other MCU entries. However, the philosophical depth often gets lost in the clunky pacing and the need to set up future storylines."
""
"The action sequences are visually impressive but lack the emotional weight needed to make them truly memorable. Without a stronger connection to the characters‚Äô individual stakes, the battles, while well-choreographed, don‚Äôt resonate as much as they should."
""
"Ultimately, Eternals is a film with enormous potential that doesn‚Äôt quite reach the heights it aims for. It‚Äôs bold and visually arresting, but its narrative struggles and uneven character development hold it back from greatness. Angelina Jolie‚Äôs Thena is a shining example of what could have been‚Äîa deeply compelling character whose story deserved more attention."
""
"For all its flaws, Eternals is still worth watching for its ambition and its willingness to push the boundaries of what a Marvel film can be. It‚Äôs not the grand masterpiece it aspires to be, but it opens the door for intriguing possibilities in the MCU‚Äôs cosmic future. With a more focused script and better character balance, this could have been one of Marvel‚Äôs best."
"Really amazing story and never got the respect it deserved. It had some amazing stories and themes in it, that should‚Äôve been seen and loved more."
The storyline is hard to follow as it jumps between time periods and unrelated scenes. Some great actors overshadowed by a weak script and other poor actors. It was dull and drawn out to start but got better.The surprise ending was my favourite. If he is in the next movie then I am watching for sure.
"Eternos √© uma obra-prima cinematogr√°fica que eleva o universo Marvel a novas alturas. O elenco estelar, incluindo Gemma Chan, Richard Madden e Salma Hayek, entrega performances carism√°ticas e profundas. Os efeitos visuais impressionantes criam uma experi√™ncia imersiva, transportando o espectador para um mundo √©pico."
""
"O figurino incr√≠vel, desenhado por Ruth E. Carter, combina perfeitamente com a dire√ß√£o vision√°ria de Chlo√© Zhao, que equilibra a√ß√£o, drama e emo√ß√£o com maestria. A hist√≥ria emocionante e complexa explora temas universais, como identidade, lealdade e sacrif√≠cio."
""
"""Eternos"" √© um filme que me fascina demais, como f√£s de quadrinhos e cin√©filo igualmente."
This was probably the most forgettable MCU movie I've ever watched. Literally all I remember from the movie was them trying to stop a big man from destroying the earth and it's it.
Would not recommend and the story was horrendous.
"Sweeping superhero tale through centuries with character at its core. The visuals are amazing and present the best version of a ‚Äúspeedster‚Äù of any medium. Jolie brings a gravitas that almost makes her feel like she‚Äôs in a different movie. The more I watch the film, the more I like it. Eternals spends most of the movie introducing and fleshing out new characters to the MCU, which is why I hope for a well deserved sequel."
"Definitivamente es algo fresco para marvel, explora un territorio nuevo y es algo bueno. Se hace lenta en algunos momentos pero es una pel√≠cula con buena historia y trama y hermosos efectos visuales, dir√≠a que es una de las mejores de la fase 4. pero obvio al reci√©n terminada avengers end game la sentir√°n como insuficiente. Pero es todo lo contrario, es una muy buena pel√≠cula que merece ser continuada, sus personajes son muy interesantes y me gustar√≠a seguir viendo m√°s de ellos en el futuro de marvel."
Dire√ß√£o: Ok
Atua√ß√£o: Ok
Roteiro: Ruim
Caracteriza√ß√£o: Ruim
Soundtrack: Ok
This just might be my least favorite marvel film.
"A Zhao movie is like seeing an opera at the cinema. Drama, humor, chaos, love, compassion, ethical crisis, family. Everything mixed together at the same time. When they call it slow and boring, it is actually a profound construction of what it means to be human, and the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat this requires. The characters were well explored but not too much, which allows them to develop even more and better with a sequel. Marvel's most mature movie yet. With fantastic actors, superb visual effects and a very well adapted story... with legs, for so much more!"
"Nice ,but sometimes boring..."
They need to make another one
Can't wait for Eternals 2. Hope critics don't ruin this for who loved the movie.
"‚ÄúEternals‚Äù is an ambitious effort from Marvel, but it bites off more than it can chew with an uneven story and too many characters to introduce and develop in just a two and a half hour runtime. It probably would‚Äôve worked better as a TV series."
"Eternals is boring. The characters lack depth and the story does little to entertain. It was so insignificant, it took Marvel Studios nearly four years to even acknowledge that the Eternals was part of the MCU in the next Captain America movie."
"Overall pretty good and somewhat enjoyable Marvel flick. Some really interesting cinematography and visuals.  Great characters created by Jack Kirby were, unfortunately, portrayed in a somewhat diminished, two-dimensional form. Story was just ok. Not great...but worth watching one time."
"Its a great movie! Not really a normal marvel style. The story was fun, acting was good, great visual effects, and great costume design. And its sooooooo underrated"
I know critics don‚Äôt rate it highly but honestly if they do the sequel right it could be really solid
I‚Äôm not sure what it is about this movie that keeps drawing me back to it.
""
"I want to love it, I want to even really like it, but I just can‚Äôt and that annoys me. This movie has everything there, it explores concepts that I love in fiction, and is based on the creations of the most creative person in the history of comics. To make a boring movie about Jack Kirby‚Äôs cosmos is a sin."
""
"There‚Äôs a lot to like here. It‚Äôs shot beautifully for a Marvel film. The fact that it was shot mostly on location and not on sets shows, and add a layer of authenticity and earnestness that the film requires. I also do like the characters. I find them mostly interesting and compelling in their own ways. Sersi‚Äôs struggles with loving humanity yet remaining loyal to her mission. Ikaris thinking he is loyal to Arishem and subsequently realizing that his love for Sersi (a human emotion) is what truly drives him. Other than the two of them however, the characters lack in major places for the rest of the cast. Sprite, Druig, Makkari and Thena all have interesting motives, and I‚Äôd love to know more about them, but their arcs are left either incomplete or fall flat. Then there‚Äôs Ajak, Kingo, Phastos, and Gilgamesh who are left as nothing more than filler in the scramble for screen time. I don‚Äôt think it was impossible for a movie that‚Äôs 160 minutes long to properly introduce and pay off 10 separate characters, but Eternals fails to do it."
""
"Gettin into it a bit deeper, I think there are two places where this film is majorly let down. Number one is the pacing. We cut throughout all of human existence in this film, and while the scenes we spend throughout the past do a lot to develop the characters and display their secret impact on the world, I think a lot of those scenes are placed poorly within the story of the film. There are certain scenes (such as the early one where the team splits in Central America) that‚Äôs emotional impact would land much better later into the film, where we have met all of the characters and have spent more time with them together. There are others that would have made more sense earlier, as to keep some forward momentum going after the movie begins to drag in the second and third acts. Ikaris talking to Ajak and his subsequent heel turn would‚Äôve been better suited as an early reveal, as after Arishem reveals the truth about the Emergence to Sersi, the film struggles to find an antagonist to keep the audience invested in."
""
"Speaking of antagonists, the deviants do this movie a huge disservice. Not only are the action sequences starring them unforgivably boring and dull, but in no way is their presence throughout 3/4ths of the film paid off in any satisfactory manor. Kro is simply killed as though he was not the primary antagonist for the majority of the story. There‚Äôs no reason that this movie should‚Äôve had him remain a villain, especially seeing as both the Deviants and the Eternals are both created and manipulated by the Celestials all the same. The movie points in the direction of them becoming friendly towards the deviants, only to abandon that and move onto the Tiamut plot."
""
"With the Celestials, I remember my main issue walking out of the movie initially being that its scale was simultaneously too large and too small. I expected to see more of the Celestials, more of their impact on the cosmos. I wanted to see Kirby style scenes of them creating stars and the birth of the universe. The small glimpses off that stuff that are there are easily the most inspired visuals of the entire movie, but there isn‚Äôt enough of it. That being said the Tiamut problem is also entirely too large of an issue to be resolved within this single film. It creates huge repercussions for the greater universe which to this day (over 2 years since its release) have still not been addressed, even in passing conversation. The ending teasing Arishem‚Äôs judgement also begs to be further addressed and built upon, but it seems that Marvel has abandoned this storyline and these characters already."
""
"I do want to see these characters again. I want to see the wild imagination of Jack Kirby translated in a more exciting and interesting manor. I want Marvel to try again with the Eternals. I believe in this concept and I believe in the bigger picture with them. I don‚Äôt know if that will happen, and I don‚Äôt know that it will be done well if it does happen."
""
"This movie was the first time I was left flat out disappointed by the MCU, and now that‚Äôs become a trend."
""
Did I just write a full review for a movie I don‚Äôt really like and that nobody cares about or even remembers? Yes.
""
"I don‚Äôt know why, but this movie compels me"
76/100 To many characters to keep track of.
"Worst movie ever. very boring through and through, marvel should fire who ever came up with this movie. the characters suck. their powers suck. one of the heroes straight up killed themselves and there is absolutely nothing good about this movie. ROTTEN TOMATOESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
"Giveme my money back, ugly, boring and 100% woke"
The worse movie ever seen
"Some decent characters and fight scenes coupled with excellent visuals and effects, make up only slightly make up for this mostly stale movie that attempts to be bite off more than it can chew."
"√à un periodo denso per l‚ÄôMCU, specialmente per questo film, che ha la sua metafora noiosa disposta a stare con i piedi in aria in 2h 37m. Ha scene noiose, umorismo imbarazzante e ha troppi protagonisti in questa trama, ha preso un po‚Äô troppo dal suo carisma. Il tono ha un po‚Äô del suo squilibrio. Non √® un brutto film dopotutto, perch√© accoglie quel che resta dell‚Äô MCU e cerca di portarlo sullo schermo, ma in modo secco e noioso. Slvo anche lo scontro finale e gli effetti speciali. 6/10"
"Literally one of the worst marvel film's made cast was great but the story and acting was terrible, glad E2 was cancelled"
Absolutely horrible. As bad as The Marvels.
"This film attempts to write about 10 characters at once and make them all interesting and unique, but ultimately fails and ends up making them all bland and boring instead. Aside from that, the biggest problem is just that this film is SO boring. There isn't a single bit of it where I feel invested or excited, which is the polar opposite when looking at other MCU films. 1/10 -TNTDude"
"Ugh, what a mess. Blew the budget on special effects, so poor script and wooden acting, even by comic book movie standards. The cosmology is too nonsensical. I guess people who are really into the Marvel stuff will lap it up, but it is so different from the usual fare (and seems to make all of their other earth-based plots completely pointless), I have my doubts."
"Too long, but overall pretty enjoyable. This Marvel movie is different in tone and realism. Acting is ok as is the complicated plot."
It is made for only real film enjoyers
Marvel Studios are the best to make heroes. Always loved.
"Marvel Studios' Eternals features an exciting new team of Super Heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years. Following the events of Avengers: Endgame, an unexpected tragedy forces them out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants."
The director has once again managed to make a wonderful movie with good people. I liked it very much.
The most stunning visuals in the Marvel Universe! The overall story is great too
"Cancelar  a sequencia dessa obra prima de super her√≥i, √© um ERRO!"
"Eternos foi impec√°vel em CGI, atua√ß√£o e enredo. Coisas que o MCU n√£o estava conseguindo entregar depois de ULTIMATO. A Dire√ß√£o da Marvel Studios precisa urgentemente escultar os f√£s e n√£o o pr√≥prio ego."
Very boring and long
"Boring, messy, one big retcon."
"For the most part, totally nebulous and incomprehensible."
"So many great actors that are again, let down by the writing. Get it together Marvel!"
This is a different Marvel movie but it's not a bad movie. Everyone wanted another avengers movie and judged it based on that.
"Una pel√≠cula infravalorada, es una de las pocas pel√≠culas de Marvel que vi y me encanto absolutamente TODO, no entiendo a la gente que no le gusta."
"Y por culpa de esa gente Marvel cancel√≥ la segunda entrega de una de sus mejores pel√≠culas, todo por hacerle caso a la jodida critica."
Just sloppy and boring. Give it a miss
"O filme √© bom. A escala√ß√£o de atores foi perfeita, na execu√ß√£o, por ter muitos personagens, uns ganham mais destaque que outros e fica o questionamento se era realmente esses que deveriam ter mais tempo de tela. A dire√ß√£o da Zhao me agrada muito, tr√°s um frescor a f√≥rmula Marvel que j√° vem a muito sendo repetitiva. O 3¬∞ ato √© o que o filme tem de melhor. No geral √© um filme que n√£o √© sensacional, mas √© bom."
"Una pel√≠cula con una historia, ambientaci√≥n y personajes refrescantes. Tal vez para algunos tediosa de ver, pero en lo personal la considero como de las m√°s originales y entretenidas, con una direcci√≥n distinta que persigue m√°s lo contemplativo."
Cada uno de los personajes me agradaron y conect√© con ellos de alguna manera. De mis pel√≠culas favoritas de Marvel.
Worst Marvel movie made. Poor plot and poorly made. I felt that I just wasted my time watching this movie.
"could have been more better, but I liked it"
I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm the only one who likes this movie.
Where Eternals fails is that it tries to throw a lot of characters in one movie. Better if it was a series instead.
its one of the best marvel movie
"This movies frustrates me. When watching it, I could see so many ways in where if the movie had been reworked just a little bit it could have been a genuine masterpiece but because it's not, Eternals is a disappointment."
"It‚Äôs jam packed movie with an amazing cast that provides great comedy and action. It‚Äôs Marvel so you know it‚Äôll be very well done. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre not too familiar with the MCU. While this connects to the MCU, the story focuses on the Eternals themselves."
This film is complete garbage. üóëÔ∏è Do not watch this movie.
"May have been a better TV show?  Wish it were close to comic accurate...  2 out of 10, for okay ideas, too much fluff."
Felt a bit slow at times but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
"At least I can feel that effort was put into this. The ideas are good, but they don‚Äôt use the run time well. A rare case where a series could have worked better."
"Personally I loved this and so did so many others, but sadly alot of people these days like to pick things apart and tear them down without giving it a chance...I loved the characters, the story and everything with room to grow and find out more, it gave a different view on the marvel universe and opened doors for many things but sadly the way the world criticizes everything and everything is all about profit for some people and because of that we won't get the chance to see this movie series grow into something great as it should be."
I only hope more people give this great movie a chance and not compare it to previous mavel titles as it in its own is mavolous in my opinion üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I was interested in learning about the characters but, years later, I don't remember much about the movie except for the fast girl and her romance with the other guy"
This movie is so BORIIIIIIIIIING
Literally one of the most confusing movies I ever watched.
"Action is good from Marvel though bad story when you know more about Father God, Mother Goddess, and the rest of the universe. The only planet destroyer I know of was Kronos who was the original satan. I see this being refilmed or correct movie in its place with truth later. As for the celestials the planet does have an avatar though they live with humanity sometimes or in their home area most of the time. They don't need energy from people they are sons, daughters, grandchildren of Father God and Mother Goddess. All live comes from Father God and Mother Goddess. I see others issues though not going to list tell time to refilm. A lot of inspiration marvel got was from dreams/visions though this story doesn't follow that."
"A thin story, built around a large/diverse cast of characters, with little character development and less to do. Focals over writing is an industry plague. GB Frozen Empire is another prime example of this."
"I viewed this as a movie that existed outside of the MCU, after distancing myself from overwhelming amount of movies in the MCU, I found that greatly improved my viewing experience and I thoroughly enjoyed this story and characters."
Love it! ‚ù£Ô∏èBring on more!
Only gave it 4 because of Makkari Speed.
"Would just watch a recap. End of the movie has some cool fight scenes, but this is one of the worst marvel movies I‚Äôve seen"
This movie is a gem! Best marvel movie since endgame. The only slight issue is pacing which didn‚Äôt bother me because i enjoyed the amount of details and storylines they gave me but it might be an issue for some casual movie goers! Overall great film to watch with friends and family for movie nights!
Can't believe this show is getting so much criticism.
"I loved it, and all my friends raved about it as well.  The storyline simply MUST be finished."
MORE Marvels please!!
""
"I'll watch in the theatre, then watch on TV a few more times."
why on earth does richard madden keep flying like that üò≠
very questionable cgi (I really liked the ancient cities though- very cool!)
"okay plot, writing etc"
jumpscared by harry styles at the end
"One of the worst movies I watched, incredibly boring and pretty confusing with a lot of plot holes"
"I'm a huge fan of diverse casting. It reflects the changing demographics of the US and the world and it allows marginalized groups to see possibilities previously closed off to them (even ridiculous ""possibilities"" like being a superhero). Diverse casting is not, however, a substitute for a good movie, and I suspect that a number of critics thinking that it is explains how this bloated, dull turkey of a film has anyone going to bat for it. Look: we got multiple ethnicticies and queer characters and disabled characters all packed into one film! It must be good!"
""
But it's not. It's bad as a superhero movie: the fights are dull and lack any sense of danger; the visuals are odd and uninspired; the characters are dour and unsympathetic; it's not clear who we're rooting against and why.
""
"It's bad as a drama, wasting so much time on a silly backtory in the the ancient world and a getting-the-band-back-togther premise that no one could possible develop the actual personalities amidst the sprawling waste of time that is the plot."
""
"And for all the noise to the contrary, it's not interesting as philosophy: it dangles the provocative possibility that humans and Earth might be expendable in a cosmic utilitarian scheme before deciding, nope, humans are Earth are magic and anyone who thinks otherwise is a nazi. It tempts us with the idea of a real ethical discussion and then immediately chickens out."
""
So shave about 20% off of this grade-inflated RT critic average and you get a sense of the movie: it's about as good as the ninth Transformers sequel--long and noisy and pointless and feels even longer.
The movie dragged so much for that sake of presenting us each one of the eternals and yet failed to establish a connection strong enough to make us care about them.
""
Realy hope they work out this out in the future.
""
In terms of action and visuals it was ok.
""
"One area were it shines is in the top tier casting, and yet somehow i feel that it was underutilized. The acting is great, but it's something missing, probably that strong connection that i was talking about. They might had leveraged if they had chosen to go as a tv show instead a movie, but idk lets see what the future brings."
""
"I dont say that is a bad movie, but it's not a good one neither."
""
In the end i recomend ppl to watch it and made their one conclusions. (it's not a wast a time)
This would have worked better as a long series.  Time to develop the characters.  Ending wasn't great. Still a fun ride.
"Many say it's the worst thing about Marvel, but believe me, it's not. Visually I consider it good, in the plot part as well and in the special effects as well. recommendable"
"This movie was so bad that I honestly was on my phone most of the time. I tried to force myself to watch it because I wanted to watch the whole MCU timeline, but I couldn't."
"It could have been better, but overall I enjoyed it. I think there were just too many new characters to introduce."
"I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie ,every second of this movie was perfect. I couldn't even blink it was beautifully made. Crossing my fingers and wishing that there is a part 2."
I'm not quite sure what Marvel was doing with this one. It gave the same energy as the original Hulk movie and I hope Marvel doesn't end up switching roles and confusing us with this one.
"I think it's a very underrated movie, coming out during Covid too. It deserves its sequel. The movie was one of the greats that came out during that period of movie releases."
"A Really interesting story, stacked cast, great cinematography. If you shelve this. It's a disservice."
"Not a perfect movie but it is much better than the numbers say.  It's long but very entertaining and if you love the comics, it's a must see!"
This was not as good as it could have been but I liked it. Would like to see more about the Celestials.
Not the worst movie I have ever seen. But it is the worst Marvel movie I have seen
By far the worst marvel movie I've ever seen. I cannot believe they actually put this out.
"If you ever wanted an artsy, deep, thoughtful, fun superhero movie.  Here it is. Recommend for anyone looking for a marvel formula palette cleanser. Although it can be formulatic at times it seems different, in a good way.  At least to me!!"
"Thank God I waited and recorded it when it was free because I would've been embarrassed spending money on that. What producers and Hollywood people get a boatload of other peoples money and says ""hey, let's make a movie about a group of God type people that no one has ever heard of or read their comic books And tie it into the Marvel universe so we can ride on their reputation of greatness?"" Who does that?"
"This movie failed in so many ways I can't describe them all‚Ä¶ CGI wasn't half bad, they take one of the best actresses of our time and give her a half a dozen lines in the whole movie, half the time is spent doing mundane and interpersonal relationships And the action, if you can call it that, is short-lived for each encounter and uneventful. I honestly don't see how the audience gave this is 77%. All I can say is thankfully it was free‚Ä¶"
"There's the germ of a good idea here; the ancient gods being resurrected and changing over time; and their modern regime; and it's struggles; and their attempts to stop the apocolypse...But this is such COMIC BOOK writing...Why couldn't they have gotten more serious writers and addressed this on a deeper, cooler, more epic level; as opposed to another stupid episode of Smallville?  The ideas aren't bad but the execution is very mid, very meh, very comic book ..It's the kind of thing that will be laughed at and ridiculed down the road...Much like disco and break dancing movies are now...Or stupid Rom/coms from the 2000s...It isn't SERIOUS."
""
Overall: Not recommended
Very Underrated film. It will age well.
"De lo mejor de marvel, creo que muchas de las cr√≠ticas negativas son superficiales."
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever sat through. Well I made it to 45 minutes hence the half star. It would have been given no stars but since I walked out I could not speak to the rest of the movie.  I also realize this review is late but it will hopefully stop you from wasting any of your time or at least 45 minutes.
Lost my intrest halfway then continued watching and then just left
"Freshest MCU movie to date imo. Rewatched it and it still holds up on its own. The world building is perfect, and relationships between the cast members is believable and relatable. The movie gets hate for no reason, actually for bad reason, as all the MCU movies that follow up until the end of 2023 is so bad that you really wish Eternals carried the torch on how to keep MCU movies fresh for the next phases. Audiences need to grow with the movies (most of us are working, married with kids, paying huge bills, etc. now) and we need MCU movies that are completely different with the cookie cutters to be exciting again. 10/10 and I hope the sequel stays exactly the same design-wise, bring back the director please."
The fight scenes were fun to watch but pretty short.  The time jumping is annoying.  Unnecessary love interest.  The plot is dumb to me.  Tries making infinity stones irrelevant.  But the celestials are so unnecessary and unneeded.
"A wandering landscape, epic timelines, they fit a novel into the pictures and relationships, but not a ton of dialogue. I enjoyed it for being a chill super hero movie."
"I honestly hoped this would be a decent film, but I forget ha;f the characters names, can't even remember the one villain's name is. The story was forgettable, the character development was lacking, the pacing was off, and Kumail Nanjiani is just not a good actor."
Filme mediano! Da para assistir e entreter-se.
"Foram muitos personagens novos para introduzir em um √∫nico filme, e pra piorar √© um grupo menos famoso da Marvel. Fora isso, o filme consegue entregar cenas interessantes."
"ODEIO ESTE FILME IDENTIT√ÅRIO, ESTRAGOU OS NOVOS HER√ìIS COM ESTAS MUDAN√áAS E INCOER√äNCIA. DECEP√á√ÉO MARVEL/ DISNEY üò§üò°üò†ü§¨üòàüëø"
Just no.. I miss the real Marvel quality..
They are not a superheros they are politicians.
Eternals is a complex events of group of synthetic super heroes. Chloe Zhao did not disappoint! from the direction to visual/ vfx it was chef's kiss! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I appreciate the mythology and marvel approach of this film, I just live every second of it! Cant wait for the sequel of Eternals! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
probably the best directed Marvel movie since infinity war and I liked it way more than I thought I would!!!
"Not sure why it got ripped apart by the critics. This is a very good movie, great acting and a fun plot. I love all parts of it and i cant wait for a part 2."
"The most human, beautiful, endearing masterpiece ever to grace the comic book world."
These movies are getting worse and worse... can't believe I keep going to anything with the Marvel brand.
Despite sone if the other ratings I thought this was a well done movie they are really reaching for some of the marvel stories but this one was pretty and thoughtout and led you think there is more to come. Angelina crushed it and it was cool to see some of the ties to other marvel movies! pretty well done.
Complete garbage. I don't understand how anyone would like it. It's boring.
Was not a big fan of this movie
"so disappointed this wasn't more successful. I loved it. It was ""evolved"" as a super hero movie. I stopped and rewatched the philosophical debates. I wish a philosophy professor would use it to do an anatomy of the different view points different categories when they ""followed their heart"". and I Laughed out loud so many times. I hope there will be more, and its too bad all those fan boys out there can't see it for what it is."
Finally watched it because it came on tv. I'm glad I didn't pay to watch this in the theaters. Gave an extra star because they spent a lot of money making this üí©
"My God, they never read any of Jack Kirby's 1976 masterpiece. They couldn't even get Ikaris's name right. It's not ""Icarus"" it's ""Ike Harris."""
"This story got so lost in translation. The actual story was 3 races of earth's evolution,  not androids in space. There was an ancient war. The Celestials tried teaching all 3 races is if we don't learn to put the past behind us,we will be destroyed."
They try to agree to disagree and find commonality to show we're up to trying.
That's pretty much it.
"This piece of üí© story is so lost in translation Ikaris is not the hero of the story, he's a traitor (and it makes no sense). The Deviants are android jerks and learn nothing. Celestials are the bullies of the story and they stand against their creations and the people of earth."
"In the books, you fight a Celestial, they win you lose, and they can easily kill most Marvel characters."
What the hell were they thinking?
"I loved the movie, it was epic!"
Next time you wanna waste my time atleast pay for my ticket
Wow...just wow.   Who thought this was a good idea?
"I watched this movie just recently 2/7/24. I came in with no expectations, since half the reviews were not good. Well I have to say I liked this movie. It told a good story, the acting was good, and it left me anxious for the next movie in this franchise. I really can't understand some of the visceral hate for this movie. It's definitely not another run of the mill marvel movie, and for that I am thrilled . Go on with no expectations, and an open mind then watch and enjoy this movie."
"You can see what they were going for but ultimately it's just too long, has too many new characters dumped on you all at once and just doesn't really work especially in comparison to say, Logan which is an artist superhero film that really sticks the landing."
A giant hand emerge from the depth of the earth and the avengers... Wait! Where were they!?
Movies was great can't wait for part two !!!
"Terrible movie, marvels weak attempt at recapturing audiences"
"Story of lots of great action, terrible story, typical Disney flick recycling old themes with a new skin."
worse marvel movie ever. The action scene at the end was fine tho and was the only thing that makes me give it a half star rather than zero. Actually it's not possible to give it zero stars but if it was then I would've done it.
"With the Infinity Saga coming to a close, Marvel is attempting to change their formula to try new things with their films. Eternals however, is not the correct formula. A plot that is filled with holes and lacks anything interesting mixed with characters that change sides and motivations constantly equals rotten. By the end, I just wanted the weightless story to come to a close. Much like Ikaris, if I was in the movie, I would fly to my certain death."
"This film is the most majestic and truly marvelous film we've gotten from the MCU to date. It tells a great story of these ten eternal beings throughout Earth's history with very deep pathos, philosophy, and symbolism. Not to mention, the best visuals in the MCU to date with great action scenes. You definitely get a sense of who each of the ten characters is to their core by the end of the film, and the various ways they have evolved throughout their time on earth."
"It is almost impossible for the mind to comprehend that the Oscar-winning director of NOMADLAND, one of my favorite films of the last several years, is also responsible for this mess. Quite frankly, it is close to a complete disaster. Overlong, uninvolving with lazy performances and repetitive special effects. Those more familiar with the Marvel universe may understand more about what's going on, but I was totally lost with characters that come and go out of nowhere and a non linear storyline that literally goes back and forth between multiple centuries. Worst of all, the whole enterprise lacks even the smallest amount of joy or enthusiasm. This is the first Marvel movie I've seen (and I've probably seen about half of them) that felt dead on arrival."
"Eternals is a rare misfire by marvel. Definitely some good character moments and action sequences. But on the whole, it's a cluttered film with too many characters and plot points. Some of them don't even end anywhere and some aren't even established. This results in an exhausting watch."
"Loved Eternals, great world building & characters. Not sure if Marvel is going to go any further with it though."
"This gets one star as opposed to a half due to one or two competently-done fight scenes, but my word this film is a letdown. I was so hopeful, and all I got was disappointment and boredom."
"I didn't know what to expect going in, but I was pleasantly surprised by the end.  The visuals and animations are amazing, and the fight scenes are well choreographed.  It's different but definitely worth a watch."
The amount of plotholes this movie creates is just incredible.
"Real fans of the MCU will love this and I have already self-identified as an old man who liked comic books best when it was Superman, Lex Luthor and damsel-in-distress Lois Lane."
Beyond that I'm like Angelina Jolie in a superhero movie. Wait. What?
"Hey, wasn't this the movie that everyone thought would reshape cinatography forever, before it's release? I feel it didn't live up to that."
"I strongly feel that the people involved in the making of this movie have no idea what the point of movies is.  People see movies to be entertained, sometimes even to be educated or enlightened.  This movie did none of these and these people should go directly to movie jail, where they can make no more big budget movies until they can prove their worth making low budget fair."
So bad. Everything about this film is junk. The only redeeming quality is the amount of good looking people they cast...
"Boring, aimless, waste of time. How does Disney manage to squander that much acting talent in one film?"
"I lost my time watching this movie. Commercials were excellent, but whole movie..."
Very Underrated very different Marvel Studios movie! Loved it. Must watch.
This was a pretty good movie.  Pretty disappointed that i lottery myself get convinced it wasn't.  Better than Dr. Strange 2 and Thor 3.  Rotten tomatoes should reduce the weight of critics who's results are reguarly inconsistent with audience scores.
The critics were wrong on this one. It's nowhere near the best MCU film but I love the slow burn and dialogue heavy nature of this movie. The visuals are great as well and they managed to do evil Superman better in this than in the DCEU so it gets a few brownie points.
Very boring movie. What happend to the action?
"tinha tudo pra ser bom mas por falta de tempo acabou sendo extremamente med√≠ocre, a hist√≥ria √© interessante mas os personagens n√£o tem desenvolvimento, e eu nem julgo, n√£o d√° da desenvolver e aprofundar 7 personagens em 2 horas de filme, mas apesar de tudo √© um filme interessante de assistir e muito subestimado"
"The plot is incredibly hard to follow and even when I can tell what's happening I can't SEE what's happening because it's so dark all the time. The cast is too big, I can't remember most of their names, and other than one character none of the powers really stand out as original. I did enjoy certain aspects of the film but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film. Overall if you're considering renting or buying thus movie it is not worth it."
I was surprised that it wasn't as huge of a mess like I heard. It does have too many characters with not enough to do.
"I liked Sersi as a character, but not having enough time to really be her own character, she falls a bit flat. Sprite is such a thought provoking character and I wished she had more time to explore her personal difficulties and explore her attempting adult life but failing and being extremely torn apart about it. I liked Angelina Jolie's character essentially battling mental illness, but like everything it's just half baked. It's sad, I can see a good movie here but this just isn't one."
"It would have been better to make the story based around 3-4 characters, Sersi, Icarus, Sprite and Kinkango or Athena. I think it was a huge misstep to have some of the characters seemingly have huge ideological differences and it not be a problem until the finale."
"If I were to redo this, make the whole movie a who dun it. Have the introduction be a funeral, and then spread out and have more eternals die quickly, and then the final few stick together. That way we get more time with the characters we have. Of course, the plot would only change very slightly this way since the auxiliary Eternals aren't really used and feel like they are there because they're in the comics. Boo, don't be so married to it. If you want them, then bring them back to life with the success of the final confrontation, what we have is just bad, but really it wasn't awful."
"For better or worse Eternals is an ambitious project that tried to move away from the Marvel standard of fast paced storytelling and characters making non-stop quips. The premise is an intense high-fantasy, a large cast of immortals acting like a dysfunctional family, with their issues and the way they cope with them scaled up as much as their godhood in often Shakespearean fashion."
""
"First, Eternals tries to do a lot. It attempts to fit 10 compelling characters many with their own stories, intelligent relationships and personal dramas into a hyper grand premise, a multilayered mystery plot riddled with provoking moral dilemmas, convince us of a world where the natural order is mass genocide from sentient cosmic forces, hell even the throwaway antagonist has meaningful motive; all into a film with a very reasonable runtime."
""
"It quickly became apparent how easy it was to nitpick at flaws in this massive project so I'll address the most notable ones. It fails to reinforce its most consistent and encompassing theme, what it means to be human. How the film wrapped up certain character narratives unsatisfyingly (Sprite & Kingo), characters making choices that may alienate viewers (Like every Eternal at some point) and the Deviant subplot feeling too separate from the main story by the final act."
""
"However, a lot worked for me too. Starting with the cinematography, the movie was very beautifully shot. Unlike most Marvel productions that are all ADHD & go-go-go scenes actually take their time to bask and settle. Also the film has the viewers often feel the moral struggles of its characters and I love that. I find personal stories from the existential perspective of immortals very compelling and there's a lot of material there in that regard. (I mean, there's 10 of them!) Finally this should go without saying but the action choreography is top notch as always."
""
"Eternals is a success, it may have chewed off more than it can handle but it's one of Marvel's most provoking and complex projects in every sense. It's bloated and borderline convoluted but it was still enjoyable and is exactly the type of ambitious thing I want to see from them instead of churning out the same brainless style/tone over and over."
"Truly underrated, better than Iron Man 2 (worst MCU movie)."
"A terrible, pointless film with a terrible, pointless plot and terrible, pointless characters."
"Heh, this is my fauvorite Marvel movie, I have no idea how, it is what it is, and honestly I dont feel the movie slow."
Wow
Eternals said it's different from any other MCU film but wasn't this is one of the worst MCU films very stupid too.
"To my surprise, considering the negative reviews and the general concensus of the film being 'bad', I went in with low expectations."
""
"I was surprised to find that the film was thoroughly enjoyable, hitting all of the requirements of a modern superhero film. Great action scenes, appropriate levels of humour, adequately good acting and a decent enough plot! Sure, the film isn't full of twists, turns or huge surprises, but there is enough going on to keep me entertained."
"This movie is very fun despite it has its flaws. Its different than any MCU movies, i can't wait for the sequel"
"I have tried to watch this many times, pulled in by the MCU and cast. The movie simply could not grab my attention or create any real excitement, despite big cgi effects, powerful characters and a vast universe of backstory to work with. Unfortunately the first of many MCU dumpster fires."
Los villanos son decentes la acci√≥n es buena los efectos son buenos los personajes regulares es buena pero no tan buena es un 7.6 de 10
"I honestly don't get the negativity towards this movie. I found this movie intelligent and moving. I don't get how this movie gets 47% on Tomatometer, but Blue Beetle gets 78%. I don't understand. Maybe its just me."
"Eternal is a good movie, in my opinion. Characters are interesting, they have chemistry together, a fantastic scene, and the actor and actress provide a wonderful performance. I think that in time, everyone will see its worth."
"Not great, not terrible, pretty forgetable, but has some intriguing moments and otherwise a solid basis. Certainly not the best of the Marvels and not really a good  contribution to the overall MCU - it opens way too many questions and issues. The final boss is pretty laughable, but alas, it passes the time and is somewhat consistent in its quality. There are a few annoying characters and plot points, but it's easy to disconnect this from the rest of the MCU, especially if you've already given up on getting a good overarching plot line again. So watch it just as a standalone movie and pretend it has no further connection to anything else I guess."
"A film that is said to be neither good nor bad, Eternal itself has its own characteristics in writing characters and stories. The depiction of the world before the Avengers is presented in a unique way."
"Underrated Masterpiece. Don't watch it as an MCU movie, but as a Movie."
"Wasn't as bad as I've heard people say it is, but I feel it would have been much more successful as a TV show. It would have given it alot more time to develop the large main casts characters."
A lot in store here. It wasn‚Äôt the best Marvel movie I‚Äôve seen but totally worth the watch and the characters were likable. Visuals were on par with Marvel and impressive! Stay tuned after the initial refits for a little nugget.
Absolutely stunning visually and such a change of pace for Marvel which was much needed and it was fantastic.
The star-studded cast could not save this slow sinking ship. The long running time and uninteresting characters made this the least pathos-driven movie in the studios' repertoire.
Most underrated movie from Marvel

"Too many unknown characters, too many unanswered questions, too soon."
""
"After Covid MARVEL seemingly decided to put things on screen out of order and out of context. This film doesn't make sense where they released it - same with the Black Widow movie. The film is great, but it feels like the middle section of a three film arc, but you haven't seen the other two bits yet...."
""
"For me the celestials were insanely impressive, the capturing of SCALE was awesome by the director, and the stand out character ARC for me was Dane Whitman. Bumbling professor who is in a world he doesnt understand, and his involvement keeps increasing to the point of unravelling his heritage.... this should have been the story, with the eternals as the aside."
""
"The film is definitely worth a watch, but the sub-par cgi in the post credit scenes is jarring, and the point of the film is yet to be seen / mentioned in the mcu at all. As i say, wayyyy too early."
"I had to come on here and write a review because this is the only movie that I've seen in a theatre where the audience and myself busted out laughing AT the movie (not with it). Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad visuals. I think we were being punked."
"I liked it but I think there were too many new characters so not enough time to explore them. Also they focused on the least interesting, I would have loved more Phastos, Makkari, Thena and Gilgamesh and less Sersi and Ikaris"
"It's not an avenger movie, but the visuals are awesome and the plot as well"
This is objectively bad. But I somehow subjectively like it. The music is good too. Better than Endgame for me.
Zhao's creative instincts are underutilized in a predictable MCU film
I thought Eternals was pretty good. It was cool over all in my opinion.
"The movie was a bit long for me but I get it that they want to show us all of the characters. It has a very good fight sequences and the vfx was good. This is also the first film that I've seen a speedster in a real speed, not in slow motion! (Shout out flash). All in all, it is a fresh-air to see it in the MCU"
""
47% was not the right rating to give in this movie.
"The characters in this movie are done so well, i connected with most of them and the visuals are stunning. the most cinematic MCU movie dare i say it"
"For 11/2021: Marvel Studios presents their next big team of superheroes Directed by Chloe Zao she assembles a very rich, diversified cast in this long roster After Thanos wiped out half the universe and Tony Stark bringing everyone back due to his sacrifice it provided the necessary energy to create an event called the Emergence; basically this would wipe the slate clean on planet Earth for other worlds to exist 7,000 years ago beings called Eternals gifted with immortality and amazing powers arrived from the planet Olympia or did they?; they were instructed to not interfere with human history or conflicts by Celestials unless creatures called Deviants were involved The Eternals comprise of 5 fighters and 5 thinkers; Ikaris who can fly, shoot beams from his eyes, and have superhuman strength, Makkari who has super speed and is deaf, Thena the goddess of war who can create all kinds of weapons, Sersi who can manipulate matter, Druig who can control people's minds, Kingo who's a Bollywood star but more joking than anyone that can fire projectiles from his hands, Phastos who can control any type of technology, Ajak who can heal people, Gilgamesh who can deliver super powered punches, and Sprite who can create illusions Even though they've shaped our cultures and civilizations since the dawn of time it's a heavy burden for them all they couldn't lift a finger to help humanity, heck they even explain why they didn't help the Avengers Now with the Emergence on the rise these immortal warriors have to band together to protect what they now hold dear even going against their prime directive Kros, is one their many obstacles being in charge of the Deviants making them believe they can't protect humans next to Jemiah the Analyzer who created the Eternals and Arishem, their master It‚Äôs the 3rd longest MCU entry next to 'Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame' but still good for fans that have been keeping with this franchise since 2008; brings all the enjoyment you‚Äôd expect albeit minor flaws included It takes some getting used to the exposition But the action is impressive, love the big world building, this rich diverse cast, the costumes, and it opens more of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in multiple directions Love this musical score too Ajax is the almighty leader yet she can‚Äôt let anyone interfere with human history lest them hindering their natural evolution, Kingo is the funny comic relief with his Bollywood personality, Sprite is the free youthful spirit being that she‚Äôs stunted in her growth being an immortal teenager, Sersi is the heart of the group feeling she used to have a romance with Ikkaris, Thena is the fierce warrior sticking to her duties yet she‚Äôs feeling weak with her memories since she‚Äôs been around for eons, Druig wishes everyone should have a common ground, Gilgamesh is the calming one for Thena, and Phastos feels ashamed of his tinkering considering how humans have used machines to kill each other so he‚Äôs found human connection living a domestic life This entry is more dramatic than bombastic or cartoony which might not sit well with many; villains are kinda lame to be honest with Kro only being in here for 5 min and Arishem who‚Äôs kinda sitting in the background It stinks 2 characters in here are axed off quick being part of this main family A lot of the environments feel empty and boring since it‚Äôs a lot of deserts, oceans, grass fields, beaches and volcanoes Still, it does show how others involved with humanity's development would've shifted things allowing us to evolve, thrive, learn from our mistakes Human nature is what it is; sometimes it's unavoidable or not our place to change what has to unfold Without our flaws and mistakes we couldn‚Äôt stand out or learn to be better Chloe Zhao knows her characters and their interpersonal relationships, she has them dig deep into themselves about whether they should do more than what they were made for or not bother getting attached to a planet inhabited It‚Äôs definitely a heavy toll being immortal and having to watch over civilizations far slower than others as far as weapons and modern technology One of those rare superhero films to make the viewer think The casting here is also a true profession of representation in film The mid credits scene is crazy and the after credits scene....very ambiguous It‚Äôs a lot of mystery for the future to unfold that‚Äôs for sure 25 movies in and Marvel Studios is still showing their love and passion for an ever-expanding multitude of stories from the pages of the comics This one isn‚Äôt perfect and will be very divisive but you can tell they are trying to open more doors for further adventures and that‚Äôs fine by me as a comic book movie lover"
"No me gusto la peli, esas fueron 2 horas y 7 minutos de mi vida que no voy a recuperar, mal√≠sima, no recomiendo esta pelicula"
More interesting than other Marvel movies. It felt more character driven and less explosion driven. I was bored of the usual marvel format in the 2010s. This was refreshing.
The opening scene annoyed me the most. It started with an interesting premise and then the way it was acted out was as if it was done by a child. Like what a little boy would think was super cool.
""
"You'd think that moviemakers have had plenty of practice, and should be getting better. Overall, it was quite mediocre."
Boring... Boring... BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
too hyped up which made the movie dissapointing
HEY #DISNEY #MARVEL.
""
"You did fine here. I like it. This was actually a refreshing approach. Having a designated profound and naval gazing team is actual nice between quirky goofballs or depression psychopaths. The more flavors you have, the better the icecream shop, I say."
""
"That being said, here are my complaints."
"1) Gilgamesh. Now, hurray for color blind casting. That is great. Good for you.........but you have a mesopotamian Hercules and you did not think to hire a middle eastern guy to play him? Yeah, I know the comic did not look like a mesopotamian hercules, but...........come on! I know wrestling is popular in the middle east. I AM PERSIAN AMERICAN. You could have found a big middle eastern dude willing to read a few lines before getting killed. Would have been fine. We got body builders for days. But you got a husky east asian dude instead.................... care to cast a mexican for Anubis next while you're at it? Maybe a swedish Ganesh?"
2) The spit-wine scene was stupid. Whomever wrote that scene should be hit with a truck.
Here is a list of funny hobbies for an immortal to have.
"A) Tortoise farming and breeding (Ends in rainbow tortoise, poodle tortoise, or high speed tortoise breeds)."
"B ) world's most complete collection of cheeses (Even the maggot cheese, the vein cheeses, and the last of the woolly mammoth cheese)"
C) Digging a tunnel to the center of the earth and that is how the celestial is discovered. (Cameo from mole men is optional. Deviants living in subterranean lairs encouraged)
D ) Cave of treasure history waiting for massive ebay event.
""
Back to complaints.
3) The caveman death at the beginning was unintentionally hilarious. Shame on you for the accidental comedic timing of that.
"4) The bollywood thing was a waste of a scene. That character does not even come back to help in the fight at the end. What the hell? Good Guy or Bad Guy, you dragged us through the who film with him and used him in the trailer. Of course people left disapointed. We did not even see him DANCE IN HIS DANCE SCENE. Hire some guys from India to do a scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7K4vGYL9zI"
The exchange rate can't be that bad.
""
"AND FINALLY.......... while it sells the immortal warrior thing to show them in different historical periods, we all saw Highlander. Either really commit to the period piece segments, or figure out a better way to examine immortal characters visually. EXAMPLES!"
A ) Green Screen scenes of them throughout the MCU in the background. Forest Gump style. Phestus could be telling jokes about Ironman's antics with his engineering.
B ) Icarus standing gaurd for something and him covering in cobwebs like an old suit of armor in a forgotten museum.
"C ) have one of them work at a cancer hospital helping Make a Wish kids. ""They have so much love in them. So much hope. They deserve so much more time"" and the humans think he is talking about kids, but really he is talking about humans at large."
""
""
"Just........I really hope this gets a sequal. I really think the actors and directors did a great job. The editing and choreography was lacking (Especially dancing, but half the fights felt mild as well). Its good. Eternal heroes sworn to duty questioning their free will within that duty. THAT IS INTERESTING! Spit wine, bad bollywood, and cavemen that don't know how to panic is NOT INTERESTING!"
""
"Hope you get another whack at them.......but don't go Thor the Dark World either. You can be naval gazing, grim, AND STILL have a nice color palette."
Another Disney woke garbage bucket
I tried to see this movie about 5 times and every single time I couldn't get past 25 minutes this shit is boring as hell. Even as a comic fan it sucked
"Marvel could have done so much better, I'm disappointed with some of the plot holes there was and unanswered questions related to the villainy of some characters. Was definitely not the worst movie"
No way the critics consensus for the first Thor movie is higher than this. No way.
"It was incredible. Only issue is that it felt like it was the 3rd film not the first expects us to know the characters. Other than that it was great if not perfect, just needed films before it because this should not of been the first eternals film"
"A movie that tried too hard to be the next marvel ""event"". We're not given enough time to understand the characters and the villain is one that is thrown into the plot and not really given a unique role. *spoiler* his death is one of the most underwhelming villain deaths ever as he is killed within 2 seconds."
"Just the worst marvel movie ever. So many holes in this story. Just dont watch and pretend it doesn't exist in the storyline, it won't make a difference anyway."
"This is possibly the worst MCU movie I have ever seen. The characters are an interesting in dull and does not have any heart, nor any interesting, motivations or beliefs that we can care about. The plot is jumped from stopping aliens to saving the planet. It is just nonsensical. It‚Äôs not 2+ that makes sense together. It‚Äôs just a plot on top of a plot on top of a plot. The pacing in this movie is very boring. In infinity war pacing is real fast and real smooth because we have one objective and that objective has no time to waste or the objective is incomplete but in this movie we keep sitting down and talking about bullshit that does not your matter to the story, or doesn‚Äôt even give us a lot of information or our characters just keeps having flashbacks   and then the main objective then flashbacks then the  main objective is just wrong and off pasted the CGI is kind of good and the visuals are impressive but the story is the best thing that keeps a movie going but this story is very lack luster and dull the only character that I remember is Icarus because he‚Äôs more kind of interesting, but everybody else is just not it. Overall 1.5/10"
"I thought this movie turned out absolutely fantastic! The actors did a phenomenal job and I just got so easily attacked and hooked into the whole thing. One of the best CGI movies, so beautiful on that part. Everything was just beautiful."
It's an interesting test for the MCU to take but it doesn't quite hit its mark
"Really refreshing take for a company that badly needs to try new things. A proper scifi epic that we don't see so much of anymore. Jack Kirby's original ideas were considered too ambitious by many (leading to the cancellation of the original comic book run of Eternals in the first place) - and I think that's what's happening here as well. But still, I think that despite some flaws the interesting ideas shown in this movie really end up shining through and this film is more than worth watching if just for that."
"I rewatched this and it's actually a decent film. Definitely better than Marvel's recent crap like Thor, Dr Strange and Ant-Man. The story is self-contained and doesn't rely heavily on retcons of past events. It has some great themes and moments like defying ones fate and redemption. When Icarus surrenders to his love for Cersi and joins the Uni-mind it evokes strong emotions and satisfaction. As a whole I feel like this can work in an independent setting from the MCU. Trying to tie this in with the MCU will open up too many questions and plot holes because alot of it's major themes undercut the MCU especially it's concept of the Universe etc and the existence of Celestials etc. Other than that the acting performances were solid, the action was solid and the CGI was good. It has its corny stuff like the whole Bollywood stuff etc but it was definitely way better than sitting through something like Thor: Love and Thunder. Overall it's worth the watch."
"Without doubt worst movie of Marvel. No plot, Casting is all wrong, sub plot like Indian and wokeism  are by far the worst portrayal."
""
"If sacrificing intelligent life is essential for birth of a being then humans shd be last on the list, this movie is prime example of human ignorance."
"Made me angry, douchecanoe ruined it for me. Why was he acting like that? Mad confused. Also alien could've been a tad more helpful on the beach, missed out on making some friends."
"Toilet paper film roll, only good thing about this"
"Terrible and boring. Very irrelevant. Bad plot, too long, very generic characters. Easily it's a black sheep movie. So forgettable."
WHAT DID I JUST WATCH THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE ITS A COPY FROM A BUNCH OF OTHERS
"""Diversity"" over quality or anything anyone cares about, like story or even basic coherence. ""White man evil"" is basically the crux of it. Creative flop, to go along with being a colossal box office flop. Avoid."
"Bland, boring and uninteresting, Marvel's ""The Eternals"" is a missed opportunity and a mess."
Worst piece of media I ever saw I like the wind paramount did the marvel movies
"I do not know why they did a movie about the Eternals the story was slow and at times boring, not one of Marvels best"
This movie is good i don't know what people are complaining about.
"Eternals is an excellent film, breathtaking photography, super well done special effects and an excellent cast, Marvel Studios you are ten in this regard"
Se fosse para descrever esse filme numa palavra eu diria BOM
One of the worst Marvel movies I've seen. The first half of the movie was painstakingly slow and there was a very unnecessary and awkward sex scene in the beginning. I didn't feel attached to the characters at all nor care about any of the plot. I like to believe that this movie doesn't exist in the mcu
"uMmMmmM ewwww. this movie just suckes. phase four just sucks. marvel made a screwed , nonsensical plot, and tryed to make up for it with big name actors. btw, Angelina Jolie made the movie at least 2 stars worse. ShE SuCkS BrEhEhE. only part of the movie i can respect was the homosexual character. marvel, we need more of those."
_________Bad_________
Longest movie ever. Me and my friends love marvel and went to see it together. The cgi was so bad we all laughed the entire ending. Story seemed basic and WAAAY too many characters to care about. Barely remember their names at this point.
"Not enough screen time for the many characters introduced, the rest is solid"
this movie was a diabolical attempt to get people to clap like seals
""
they tried so hard to apeal to as a wide of an audience as they could the butchered what would have been an ok storyline with massive plot hole and badly landed decisions.
""
one of the worst movies ive ever seen and was forcedto watch it so that ive watched all the marvel movies in order
"I had to watch it more than once to follow everything that happened and I wanted to. Deep story, lots of clever side plots and characters with intertwined back stories and motivations that draw you in. A great twist in the mcu. Was thanos really a villain or was he just trying to slow down the celestials as they destroyed all life? Really creative all around"
Terrible CGI. Terrible story. I feel like these were the people who kept pestering Marvel to be in a Marvel movie and they just threw something together for these actors.
"I've only seen it once, but I thought it was stunningly beautiful cinematography with a strong cast. The plot was serviceable but nothing impressive."
Another great MCU Movie! Loved seeing new lore for the celestials! An insane post credit scene! Fantastic soundtrack! A must watch!
"Way over hated. Choppy, but not the worst movie in the MCU."
Least favorite of all the Marvel movies.  I liked the diversity of the cast and some of them had great chemistry. But the movie was disjointed and some scenes were just unnecessary or bad.  Poor choice of a director.
LA MEJOR DE MARVEL DE LOS ULTIMOS A√ëOS
"Chloe Zhou, who has the ignominious distinction of having a plutocrat tax-dodger for a dad and lives in Ojai, home of the ""rich n famous"" US TV/Film community directed, or misdirected this stubbed toe of a pointless CGI adventure fantasy."
""
"Based on a semi-classic Jack Kirby comic book about warring ancient mythologies and the link between human development and alien anthropologists, the film version here is bland and unconvincing. Scenes feel ""big"" but at the same time curiously flat and distant. The combination of classical mythology and pulp that charmed 70s era comic collectors is amiss."
""
"Given the production workflow nature of these films, I don't think Feige/Disney-Marvel inc. can actually make a film with a distinctive style or voice, but here they made the mistake of cribbing the work of a distinctive, if flawed, creative (Kirby) and making it into something far more processed, but lesser in value."
I truly don't understand the low reviews this movie received. Chloe Zhao's vision was perfect and the cinematography is astonishing. Finally we could appreciate more artistic approach to a Marvel movie instead of the rest of the franchice's films that start to feel the same after all these years.
"While there was potential here, this film didn't have enough time to flesh out each character to where we don't care about them in the third act. If this was a show, it could have been great."
"I like that film, its new!"
meilleur marvel de la phase 4 du grand art
An absolute snooze fest. I was so close to falling asleep. This movie was boring and you felt every minute of it. The only good part was the final fight scene. hense why it's 2 stars.
"I know there are some people that dislike this film, but I thought it was ok, to be honest. I enjoyed it and had a good time for the most part. I thought it was unique for sure."
The post credit scene
it was actually good but Sprite ruined it
Glad to see a quality movie can still be made within the MCU
When I first watched this film I found it long and boring. On second watch a year and a half later I actually enjoyed it. If you're looking for a good superhero movie look elsewhere but if you like marvel this isn't the worst film they've made
Love this movie. The style of filming is awesome and thr serious tone of the story makes this movie great. Also love each character and their arcs
"Great cast in this one, but the film as a whole was just an enormous bore. Far too long and far too uninteresting"
"I honestly think it was an incredible movie, funny and humorous with a great amount of action. Would definitely recommend family and friends to watch it, and sincerely hope they make a part two."
"Amazing movie with beautiful pictures, amazing CGI and very good characters. The Actors are all amazing and the story is very interesting. The movie got too much I hate, because it is different. But I love this movie."
It was definitely a movie that I watched that's about all
It's not like the comic
Bad Movie. No cohesive Story whatsoever.
Es gran pel√≠cula marvel sabe superheroes me encanta la acci√≥n y mas el villano pero no es tan buena es un 7.7 de 10
It's an AMAZING looking Movie with some bad writing and storylines but the action and visual affects are probably the best in the MCU.
"I just watched this yesteday and both my wife and I liked and hope they make a part two.   Had avoided it because of bad reviews, needless to say I should know better than ever listening to what the idiot critics say"
"One of the best Marvel's movie, no the same repetitive formula and something different."
An Eternal pile of garbage.  Wow did that stink.
"Adorei o filme, quero o 2!!!!"
Forced an laboured way past the point of fracture. The ravine sized cracks in the story and characters cannot be covered up up by pretty visuals and great direction.
""
The film was bland and most of these extremely talented actors looked unconvinced and bored with their own characters.
"I really love this movie. It really did the found family thing really good, because I really believe the relationship they have with each other. I do think it could've benefitted from a little more time, so it's a little more fleshed out. I think people don't like it as much because it's not as action-packed as other marvel but I think that just adds to it's charm."
"Potentially the most over-hated MCU project to date. Was it perfect? No. Was it the worst? Far from it. The visuals and cinematography are some of the MCUs best. And the unique direction was fresh. Sure, i'd love more screen time with certain characters, but it was all executed quite well."
"Oof, that was Rotten"
this power th√≠ family so bad
It was hard to connect with the characters throughout along with a tedious story. It did seem to pick up momentum in the final hour.
"What a great, respectful and refreshing superhero movie to watch! I think my favorite take on it is the fact that the duality good guys / bad guys is so much less obvious than in most other Marvel movies. I will change very little of it, and I'll probably watch it again a second time, if not more times than that."
"The movie is really good, i like the characters and actors, but it's not that good."
"I thought it was a very boring movie, ugly, fake, forced inclusion of Asian characters...truly the worst of the worst superhero movies."
"I regret seeing this movie, they should give me my money and time back."
"Remember when, after Raiders of the Lost Ark, some genius at MGM decided to green-light Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold?  Only in this case, Disney released a pale knockoff of its OWN franchise!  It's as if Coke decided to start bottling RC Cola.  Possibly the most WTF decision by a movie studio in history."
"Some of the effects are great but that's about it. I really wanted to like this movie because its Marvel and the big name actors. As a veteran, I especially hated that Angelina's character ended up as a big war/PTSD stereotype. Very predictable plot. The movie was also waaaay too long and boring there were several times we almost fell asleep and there was just so much unnecessary scenes/backstories."
One of the worst MCU films ever made. Slow and tedious with barely any character development. Cardboard cut-outs standing in for movie actors and a script that will send you into a coma. Don't waste your time.
"I will say Eternals is like every Marvel film, a hero, and a villain, but this time, a villain that has no motive. The plot isn't really attractive. They did the Bill Skarsg√•rd, Kro really dirty. The character was sort of interesting."
"I was scared because I've heard so many bad reviews and I LOVE marvel movies. I was preparing myself to be disappointed. Finally it's was good enough to be enjoyable. Story could be move developed maybe, but would totally go see the second in theater."
One of the worst MCU entries yet. A case of biting off more than you can chew and being left with an unsatisfactory result that leaves many questions unanswered.
Would of been better if this was turned into a series rather than a movie.
One of my favorite Marvel movies. The concept and execution hits everything I wanted.
A lot of people dont like eternals but I enjoyed it
Very boring. Couldn't finish it
"Bland and uninspiring, I found it hard to care for the characters. The main redeeming quality was the visuals."
Eternal is very great
"This movie was an absolute WTF moment. What does this movie have anything to do with anything? It feels like it was made with source material from a completely different franchise with no real discernible connection with Marvel other than a smattering of references. The casting choices were questionable, as several of the characters seemed unlikable, monotone, or at worst unbelievable... and that's a low bar to hit for fiction."
I couldn't even finish it
"The CGI action is thrilling and entertaining, the effects (naturally) astounding and general ideals interesting, but Eternals tries to make itself as complicated as possible, and in the progress makes itself near incoherent and the cast is wide and unable to pan time to all of them to make them interesting asides from one gimmick."
What it this movie even? I was soo bored. I was waiting for all of the characters to just die. This is a disaster movie
I think they need to make a second one to flesh out the characters - there wasn't enough personality and I think the second one will give it the depth it needs. That said great intro to the new universe and the ending made me ready to see the next one.
The most underrated movie I've ever seen
"Better than most of phase 5 MCU movies. Can't wait for Eternals 2. Critics underrated this movie wrong, in my humble opinion."
"The critics are insane - the movie was very good! Don't listen to them! They were also saying this is a ""very DC"" movie, to which I also highly disagree - this movie was definitely MCU, not DC. My primary concern was the number of characters, but fear not - we get just enough time to get to know each character, and each character surprisingly has a good character arc and development, with (in my opinion) the exception of one - Makkari, who should have received more time and character development. There were a couple very interesting and very good twists and turns. One minor complaint, there was a scene where suddenly, out of nowhere, a ton of exposition is just dumped on you with no preperation. It caught me waaayyy off guard. Thankfully, even if you don't catch everything from that one giant exposition dump, the rest of the movie keeps talking about it so you do catch on super quick. As with the other Phase 4 movies, it certainly leaves you excited for the future of the MCU!"
If this is what comes after endgame the mcu is over. It had a good run though.
"It's actually a good movie. Not the best. But new refreshing faces are always welcome in the MCU, its heavily underrated since it have close to none connection yet to the old faces of the verse."
It was a great storyline but could have been conveyed better. It honestly wasn't that bad but still has some anticlimactic and anti suspense moments.
i don't care what anyone says i thoroughly enjoyed eternals and how it was different than any other mcu movie to date. the soundtrack was very good as well and i always want to rewatch the movie.
"Struggling to choose between the giant sci-fi epic it deserves to be and the tried-and-true traditional Marvel film, Chlo√© Zhao's ""Eternals"" fails terrifically to be a standout (or even somewhat passable) Marvel installment."
It was a decent film neither too bad now too good but okay. The characterisation of The Eternals is poor and movie felt little bit of stretched feeling except these the movie was okay and one time watchable.
"Filme incr√≠vel, visual magn√≠fico e o elenco √© perfeito."
"Es preciosa, visualmente es una joya cinematogr√°fica. Los ojos agradecen lo que est√°n viendo durante toda la pel√≠cula. La historia es de or√≠genes y presenta a muchos personajes nuevos e interesantes, pero eso es algo que se toma su tiempo y a veces puede bajar un poco el ritmo. Pero es preferible que asienten unas bases para un futuro apote√≥sico que darte mucha acci√≥n con un mal guion."
"Boring film, flat acting, so slow...Not good!"
One of the only movies I've ever fell asleep while watching
Terrible movie. No plot. Villain kills himself from white guilt
Second worst film in the MCU. Introduces to the eternals who are immortal beings with various powers. There is a big plot twist which I thought was awful and best character is the villain. End credits scenes introduces to tons of new characters in the MCU.
This movie was awful! The movie had to many ideas. It tried to introduce to many villains which lead to a confusing plot and a unsatisfying conclusion. By the end of the movie there was a total of 4 villains! The movie throughs deaths at you which you don't care about because we don't have enough time to learn and care about the people who died. The final battle was anticlimactic. The main character literally just puts her hands on the ground then the movie was over‚Ä¶ The acting was terrible. Especially for the actress of the main eternal who I don't even remember because her character had no personality. Overall this movie rushes its plot packs to many ideas and had no idea what it was doing. 1/5
"A good visually attractive movie . But , could have done more on the story."
"A pleasant surprise, I decided to watch it after rewatching all the older marvel movies and I wasn't disappointed"
Î≠îÍ∞Ä Ïû°ÌÉï.... ÎßàÎèôÏÑùÎïåÎ¨∏Ïóê Î≥¥Í∏¥ÌñàÏßÄÎßå Ìù†..
"Not as bad as I was anticipating. But still pretty awful in places. The dialogue at times was cringe and felt amateur and devoid of depth. The plot seemed confused and convoluted and internally inconsistent. Selma Hayek was about as interesting to watch as a wet flan. Very bad casting choice. She just seemed like a washed up, 50-something actress who had forgotten how to act. I also couldn't help but sense some woke undertones to the story which undermines trust for me, when I feel like I'm being fed an agenda. And the casting of Eros also left me rolling my eyes, but I'm willing to give him a chance."
""
"That being said, there were a few surprising elements to the film I actually appreciated. Some of the theology the film explored was quite thought provoking. When viewing the fate of billions and trillions of lifeforms from the perspective of Gods, the trolley problem becomes a whole lot more interesting. To sacrifice the few for the greater good, in this regard, is a much more challenging proposition. I enjoyed seeing things from that angle."
""
"Also, the visual effects were no less than what you'd expect from a Marvel movie, which is generally fun to watch, and occasionally a little more. Though occasionally cringe at times too."
""
"The fact that I found myself wanting to see how it ends, I think is also a good sign. I don't have much hope that I'll ever want to watch it again, but it passed the time and wasn't quite as bad as I'd heard."

One final positive was Gemma Chan as Sersi. I thought she was cool and likeable as the lead and gave a subtle and impressive performance.
""
"As a contrast, one final negative was Barry Keoghan as Druig. He was creepy and dislikable."
"It seems like all the Marvel movies are getting a strange amount of negative reviews.    Maybe it's not as good as the others, but I love this movie and never thought I would get to see this characters on the big screen."
"Worst of the MCU, don't waste your time"
"Everything about this movie was bad, except some of the visuals.  I've watched it 3 or 4 times just for the scenery."
"While it's not as bad as some say, this film still struggles with juggling too many new characters."
"Thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt, just skip it. Between the ridiculous overacting and mind-numbingly boring story you're left wondering where this fits into the Marvel universe besides them saying the words ""ironman"" once or twice."
"Visually, beautiful and meditated movie. The director did and splendid work. Simply the closer approach to art than a Marvel movie has achieved."
"People who says that eternsls is a bad and boring movie, obvioulsy is a product of the cancel culture... The movie does a great job giving every character their moments to shine, beautiful filmed and there is great action scenes.. for me its a top 10 marvel movie for sure üëå"
"How in the world was this written by the same man who wrote The Truman Show? The dialogue, plot and everything about this movie is juvenile. The cast is good, but the script they had to work with was painful. The scenes were pieced together roughly, the timeline made absolutely no sense and the pacing was all over the place."
""
"I love the concept, don't get me wrong. Produced correctly, I could see In Time as a powerful television series. Unfortunately, a great idea does not make a great final product."
"I can easily say this was the worst movie I watched in the theatres. No plot, unlikeable characters, didn't feel like a marvel movie at all."
"3 stars:   a major disappointment. I thought this was one of the most ambitious plots for a Marvel movie. It just didn't live up to the ambition. Looking back, I think they just put too much on our plate. We had to follow the eternals through all known history to get to present day in order to make the point of the film. That was just entirely too long. That was plenty of star power, but they were dragged down so far into the plot that the acting became boring. I had to hit the snooze button at least twice. Probably a 2 star or 2.5 star film. But I have to admit that the Special Effects were pretty fantastic for a two-year-old movie. That was enough for a 3 stars to me."
"It's a good movie, they shoved some unnecessary plot points in there for inclusion. But overall a good movie."
Better with repeat viewing although it will never be that memorable or rewarding in the end.
It was an ok movie. Just hard for me to get into. The movie is just to hard to fathom as a real possibility. With their powers it's dumb they only can fight the machine things.
Too many character with their own stories that make this film Incredible boring to keep up with it.
This movie was great hands DOWN!
"It's hard to believe that this movie is in the same universe as Spider-Man. I'm not a marvel expert, I haven't read the comics but I enjoy the movies. I honestly I have no idea what's happening in this movie. It's hard to follow the story line and the movie seems out of place."
It has great concept and potential which was not well executed but it's not unbearable. It would have been better if it was a tv series.
"I loved it and so did everybody I talked to....the special effects are great, the story was cool and the premise was different. It hooked us right from the beginning. The suprise twist at the end just worked. I wish they would make a sequel."
"Boring, lame, not exciting and not fun to watch. If you're looking for a movie to fall asleep to with you cute girl friend this movie is perfect !. Brown guy with the camera filming things was pretty funny tho best part of the movie 10/10 for that part"
Tremenda Kgda -10/10 y zzzzz
"Overstuffed cast that isn't very memorable. I can't recall most of what happened, and I found it extremely boring. I do appreciate it being different than most MCU movies. It only wasn't executed correctly."
https://youtu.be/b1vCgWhIyNc
"Filme muito subestimado, n√£o √© igual os outros da Marvel e por isso pessoal n√£o gostou tanto. Mas √© um √≥timo filme."
It was a solid marvel movie. Not the best but I don't know why it gets so much hate.
Each time I watch the film I enjoy it more yet it lacks. It could've been so much more!
It has some amazing shots though.
So long and boring. Had a hard time getting through it.
"Watching this garbage of a movie you kind of hope they fail. The story has so many flaws. The cast are a diverse group of unlikable diversity hires written by talentless writers who are thrown in as if they had big effects on history. I still cannot fathom why beings that were created as some better beings are such trash and why anything would make such flawed beings including one that is mute... It is also insulting to all inventors that the fat black guy was inventing everything as if humans are idiots, while still acting like an idiot himself... Unlikable characters, bad story writing, and signs of a drop in visuals including the celestial that just disappears from the world by the next Marvel movie, a good example why this is more like terrible fan fiction then a real Marvel movie."
it would be an awesome movie if they didnt feel forced to speak about Thanos and the other stuff that happened in the mcu
"Forgetable characters, forgettable story. Don't see the point in making this movie. Even Harry Styles' cameo didn't make it better ;)"
"My friends, family and I rented out a theater to watch Eternals. We expected so much, but we were let down. So many points where the movie wants to peak then‚Ä¶ big let downs."
This movie got very negative reviews. So I have no expectations for this film even though Chloe Zhao was an Academy Award winning Director. But surprisingly I liked this film. Except the characterisation the whole movie was good and good attempt for Marvel Studios. Angelina Jolie was totally underutilized.
This film deserves a 4 hour extended Zhao cut. People just hate on it because they refuse to comprehend it's true scale and it made them feel like the tiny little dumb specs of insignificant nothing that we are. I personally love being reminded of that. More Eternals plz.
This movie was B.S I was excited for it the trailer looked good the comics are good but this movie disappointed with a thin plot and non memorable characters
"Disappointing, bad acting and no coherent plot here, avoid it"
eternals more like midternals i blew up when I watched this
What an eternal movie !!
This Movie is unique marvel movie
It's kinda watchable‚Ä¶
"Not great, dull action and plot"
Random and jumbled feeling when thrown into the MCU. Didn't enjoy the feel of it or like the characters.
I'm honestly really disappointed in this movie it was not what I expected and it was just a horrible movie with bad script writing
The film's pacing is horrible
Incredibly boring and didn't feel like it fit into the Marvel cinematic universe at all.
"good cast, convoluted mess of a movie and script, too many characters, no discernible plot."
"Wow that was long, and even after all that time i still don't remeber a single character from this movie. Don't be suprised when you forget that this movie exists."
A really bland movie that takes too long to progress and fails to create character arcs for most of the characters. This movie would've been more interesting as a nine-episode Disney+ show.
The worst Marvel movie ever. Don't know why they got a Indy film director to do this movie. She didn't know what a superhero movie is.
this is beyond atrocious....
"As a marvel fan,it was nice to see something a little more dark than what phase 4 has been giving us but it still has it's flaws,it does get better when I rewatched it and the cgi looks a little off but if you are a fan of marvel or like an Angelina jolie fan the you should watch it"
"It's an original movie, with good characters and a decent plot. It's not an awesome movie, but it's ok."
"It's alright! Too long though for my liking. I've never seen a movie with so many flashbacks. I didn't fall in love with the cast like I do most Marvel movies, I think they're all very different characters and some of the story didn't make sense. They built up this monster that was taking characters' abilities but then he didn't do anything at the end and got killed in his first fight."
""
"Overall, I think the movie is worth the watch. The problem with Marvel movies now is that everyone thinks if it's nowhere near Infinity War or End game level then it's automatically a 1 star. People are hard to please. Go watch it, it's not a bad movie at all."
This movie is one of the worst mcu movies no doubt but it is not terrible like for example the vfx and acting and costumes are beautiful the videography and all of that is amazing the movie suffers mainly from a bad main villain and a below average story I wouldn't watch it again but I think you should at least watch it once and if there is a sequel I wouldn't mind to watch it
"An absolute snoozefest of a movie that was difficult to sit through. Plot holes galore, the story is dull and boring, and it constantly begs the question of ""Why should I care what happens to these people?"" The characters hardly show any emotion, and they aren't enjoyable or memorable to watch in the slightest. In a movie with a large cast, it is crucial to establish personality traits to distinguish the characters from each other, and unfortunately none of the characters had any notable personality. I nearly fell asleep in the second half of the movie. Not recommended whatsoever."
Worst marvel movie I have ever watched.
Poorly written and lacking continuity.  Forgettable characters and a disjointed story line. Totally Forgettable
"Meh is the best way of describing this film. There was nothing offensive about it but their isn't much to like either. Their is cast bloat, it's too long for such a shallow story, no growth. And while I do always enjoy watching Angelina Jolie kick ass she's criminally under utilized here. Worst of all this movie kept schizophrenically switching between making you feel guilty of existing(i.e. being an irredeemable human) and humanity is special it must be saved. Be warned you will get whiplash."
Achei bacana os momentos de luta e os efeitos especiais.
"Mas achei o filme esquec√≠vel, n√£o foi muito comentado, sendo apenas mais um filme a assistir."
Tem algumas cenas empolgantes mas tamb√©m possui algumas cenas bem paradas.
"Em geral o filme √© legal, mas nada impactante."
"Eternals"" has a visually stunning presentation and ambitious world-building, but unfortunately falls short in terms of storytelling and character development. The plot is convoluted and the pacing can feel slow at times, which can make it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film. While the cast is talented, the characters lack depth and their motivations are often unclear. Overall, ""Eternals"" may be worth a watch for its impressive visuals, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling and coherent narrative."
"Absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It somehow wastes over two and a half hours not developing it's way too many characters with rather flat performances. The dumbest part of this movie has to be at its climax where Ikaris is about to lazer-eyes Sersi then suddenly remembers his love life with her that had pretty much no development in the entire movie and decides to kill himself by flying close to the sun. I'm not even kidding, that's exactly what happens. These characters would've fared so much better in a Tv series with more time to develop each one, unlike some projects that would've been better as a single movie(She-Hulk as a prime example)."
"Eternals is generic, boring and out of place. While the characters are doing a great job at portraying their roles and the visuals are stunning, it doesn't excuse it's predictability."
""
Rating: 31%
"Not absolutely horrible, but quite disappointing."
One of the worst marvel movies
This movie is torture.
"Despite an overlong length and underdeveloped characters, Eternals is still a bit underrated."
"Eternals is stunning in both cast and visuals, the main thing it lacks is stronger writing and more charisma on screen from certain key leads in its very charismatic cast."
I watched it on the plane and I turned it off before the halfway point.
So bad haven't managed to watch all the way through
"I loved the chemistry between the main cast, and the plot and lore were very interesting! I think the ending was a little so-so, along with the pacing being a bit off sometimes. But otherwise, it was a really cool movie!"
Miserable. A missed opportunity.
"I think Eternals is a decent movie, it may not be the best compared to other marvel movies. However, the superhero's abilities and the story line I thought was good. Could it have been better? YES! I wish Salma Hayek wouldn't have died so fast, along with other eternal deaths, and I wish that it would have ended better. My main issue with the movie is how weak they are, they have lived for 7,000 years? And yet they still are learning about their power? Anyways, still love the movie and especially the concept, hope this movie comes out with a second! üíñ"
I honestly think eternals is one of the best things marvel has put out. I love it!
"Buena pel√≠cula, la vi sin expectativas de nada por la gran cantidad de criticas negativas que le√≠ pero al final no comparto eso. Para empezar, no me parece para nada la peor pel√≠cula de Marvel, eso en mi opini√≥n podr√≠a estar entre Thor un mundo oscuro o Iron Man 3. Eternals no me parece una mala pel√≠cula, es buena pero tiene algunos fallos. El mayor fallo que tiene es su duraci√≥n, tranquilamente podr√≠an haber cortado algunas partes, ya que a la vez esto desencadena a otros fallos en mi opini√≥n como el ritmo aburrido y sofocante. El villano es normalito, Kro tiene una buena motivaci√≥n pero al final termina siendo muy irrelevante debido a problemas m√°s grandes como los celestiales. En cuanto a lo bueno, est√°n los personajes principales, Los Eternals, en general est√°n bien, son bien aprovechados y ninguno se siente de relleno, cada uno se siente importante en la pel√≠cula, adem√°s de ser carism√°ticos y bien representados, adem√°s de contar con buenos actores que brindan muy buenas actuaciones como Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, etc. Me gusto como exploran esa parte de la humanidad desde una perspectiva de un dios, como el prop√≥sito de los humanos que se exploran en parte de la cinta que al menos en esta partes no se explayan mucho como lo hacen en el resto de la pel√≠cula. El humor tambi√©n me gusto, no hay mucho como en otras pel√≠culas del UCM pero lo poco que hay me gusto bastante. Los efectos especiales hay que decir que est√°n muy bien, salvo algunas peque√±as cosas que no me llegaron a convencer del todo, pero est√°n mas que aprobados. En conclusi√≥n, una buena pel√≠cula de Marvel, no me parece mala, creo que cuenta una historia interesante con personajes nuevos y carism√°ticos pero falla en algunas cosas como en su ritmo bastante lento y su duraci√≥n muy larga, aunque para mi eso no arruina la cinta. La recomiendo."
"una pel√≠cula locamente sobre odiada a mi parecer , es genial un tono √∫nico mas serio  y diferente en el ucm que nos da mitologia y mas amplia historia en el ucm personajes muy entra√±ables un plow twist que no me vi venir ,efectos maravillosos junto a una filmograf√≠a muy bella de mis pel√≠culas favoritas del ucm solo por detr√°s de joyas que simplemente no puede superar  que no supera"
"Boring, not funny, and writing is terrible"
"Dumb, predictable, boring."
Could have been good. Just another rush job
bom para quem t√™m ins√¥nia.
Decent movie for superhero fans.
"Worst movie I've every seen, and I've seen em all."
"Blotted with too many characters, subplots, and constant switches in time leaves the story a bit cluttered‚Ä¶ however, every Eternals character tells their story, motives, and emotions that drives the collective story together. Along with beautiful visuals and scenes, this leads to show that this might be Marvel‚Äôs most underrated film."
Overall this was a solid film that moved the overall MCU/MCMv along so that future shows (TV & Movies) have something more than just the new big bad.
"First and foremost, I was entertained. I enjoyed the new characters and the new ideas that were separate than the Infinity Saga. There was a lot going on and some may question decisions since they can't see how this film will effect the future storyline. Let's face it, if Thena was 100% she would've whipped everyone's derriere. Mark my words, the events of this film will be send ripples thru the MCU for many movies and series to come. The new characters will grow in the same capacity as our earthly heroes have since the OG Ironman film."
I'm looking forward to the next installment.
"Eternals es algo completamente nuevo y diferente a lo que se vio en el MCU al presentar nuevos personajes que no se sab√≠a que siempre estuvieron ah√≠. A diferencia de las otras pel√≠culas de este universo, aqu√≠ tenemos un film que tiene m√°s argumento, pero puede ser tedioso para algunos que ya est√°n acostumbrados a las dem√°s pel√≠culas de Marvel. Puede llegar a aburrir ya que requiere de much√≠sima atenci√≥n. Los personajes a pesar de ser nuevos, tienen algo interesante y lo m√°s destacable de esta pel√≠cula es que se toma su trama muy en serio y tiene incluso una cosmolog√≠a por la parte de Los Celestiales y el origen de Los Eternos y Los Desviantes lo cual me pareci√≥ bastante fascinante y da cierta profundidad. Si tuviera que mencionar sobre la diversidad en los personajes, la verdad creo que est√° bien. Cada uno de Los Eternos es √∫nico a su modo y eso les da una cierta originalidad aunque hab√≠a m√°s que se tendr√≠a que haber explorado. Los Eternos no es la mejor pel√≠cula de Marvel, pero tampoco la peor y al final es un film decente y peculiar al ser algo fuera de lo que Marvel hac√≠a. La califico con un 8/10."
"There is a good movie hiding in here, but it is a terrible Marvel movie. The story being told out of order also removes any urgency that we are supposed to feel, and we don't care enough about all of the characters because they try to make ALL of the Eternals main characters. Focus on 2 or 3, not 10."
"I enjoyed the movie. It was a bit on the long side but had excellent cinematography, good story and for the most part decent acting"
"I enjoyed it!  I think fan expectations are tainting otherwise enjoyable films.  Plus, we finally get a director who wants REAL BACKGROUNDS, and we punish them with bad reviews... back to Quantumania with all you critics!"
They chose the wrong time to introduce the eternals it would of made more sense to see a post credit scene at end of infinity war with them deciding as a team to intervene against thanos an ask arishem for advice on what to do an then have arishem order them to stop thanos because if he wins no celestial will be born on earth which is what the celestials goal is all about so I doubt arishem would be cool with thanos ruining his game plan which has been in the works for thousands of years
"I am giving it 3 stars because for me it was pretty boring, nothing super interesting and they killed the characters that I actually liked and not enough of the other characters. saw it on opening weekends in theaters and haven't rewatched it since.  critics were way to harsh on this film for the wrong reasons."
"This is the worst marvel movie I've seen so far. First of all way too long, the acting is mostly boring and bad. The story is ok, but it goes way too far into details for characters that most people have never heard of or care about. IronMan showed us that there is a good way to do a movie for characters like that. Eternals has shown us there is definitely also a wrong way. I haven't seen how any of these people play into the rest of the MCU yet, and I can't imagine ever watching this movie again. There aren't many films I actively dislike, but here's one. 4.5/10"
It was a very good movie I'd watch it again. I will say it could have been better not much bet still better.
"It was good I loved it and loved the scenes at the end. I can't wait to see The Black Knight, and Star Fox in the MCU."
i really like this movie i love this movie my favoret movie
action and CGI is so cool and i like all the character
i like how eternals introduce and i cant wait to see them again in the mcu
This is the worst mcu film and not that much character development.
"The ""professional critics"" of the rotten base their criticisms on humor, because it is not possible for this film to be inferior to Thor Love and Thunder, it has an absurdly superior narrative and graphic quality. It lacks action, but it gives us interesting, deep characters and a feeling that something great is coming. Unlike any Thor movie."
I just watched it and might I say I was very skeptical at first but I had an amazing ride and the ending was wild !
"AMAZING WAY TO INTRODUCE CELESTIALS IN THE MCU AND THE BEST CGI IN WHOLE MCU! and overall great movie 4,5/5 PEAK!"
This may be the worst big budget movie I have ever seen. It steals away a portion of your life you can never get back.
"This movie would work on paper. You get a more serious movie with a hidden enemy that isn't revealed right off the bat. But odd cuts to what I consider unimportant scenes, poorly made exposition dumps, and underdeveloped characters with stationairy motivions drag the movie down. They don't explain important things, and characters just kind of do stuff."
I personally loved the movie! I thought the characters were great; also loved the storyline.
"Very boring and underwhelming. Had a lot of potential, especially with Icarus, but dropped the ball hard"
second least favorite so far behind capt marvel.   good visuals but story was just meh
"Honestly a lot of people have given this movie flak, but it's way better than half recent movies marvel have brought out."
"Interesting story, great cast and just a real nice change of pace to the usual marvel movie formula, which I personally have been over after the first few movies from marvel."
"A good introduction to a whole new cast of characters.  I liken it to Guardians of the Galaxy, but with a different tone; whereas Guardians was a comedy, this was more of a historic piece (or more a re-imagined history).  Give it a chance, ignore the ""professional"" critics, decide for yourself."
"Plot was weak, characters were meh. Not a good movie."
"This movie was so amazing. A breath of fresh air. I dont why these fake ""critics"" hated such an awesome movie. I watched this movie like 5 times now. Chloe Zhao created one of the best speeder scenes ever in movie history! We want more Eternals!"
"Eternals. Simplemente hermosa, la fotograf√≠a y los efectos, de los personajes no tengo mucho que decir, y aunque va a su propio ritmo es genial, dejaron muchas preguntas sin responder pero aun as√≠ la arquitectura de esta pel√≠cula esta buena"
Worst movie üé• I hate it god
"Falt√≥ algo m√°s, no es mala"
"""Eternals"" (2021) is a superhero film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Chlo√© Zhao and starring a talented ensemble cast including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, and more. The film follows the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who have lived among humanity for thousands of years, as they come together to protect Earth from their enemies, the Deviants."
""
"The film boasts stunning visuals, with its lush and fantastical world-building and stunningly realized special effects making it a feast for the eyes. The film also has an engaging and complex plot that weaves together several different story threads and characters in a satisfying way."
""
"The cast of ""Eternals"" is outstanding, with Angelina Jolie delivering a standout performance as the fierce warrior, Thena, and Richard Madden bringing a sense of humanity and vulnerability to the role of Ikaris. The film also features strong performances from its supporting cast, with Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, and others delivering memorable and standout turns."
""
"The direction by Chlo√© Zhao is top-notch, with a confident and clear vision that brings the film's fantastical elements to life. However, some viewers may find the film's pacing slow, with long stretches of character development and world-building that may prove a challenge for those seeking non-stop action."
""
"Overall, ""Eternals"" (2021) is a visually stunning and emotionally engaging superhero film that will appeal to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the genre. While it may be a bit slow-paced for some viewers, it is a well-executed and beautifully realized film that is well worth checking out."
"The poor ratings for this movie are absurd. It‚Äôs out of my favorite Marvel movies. This cast is A+, all character motivations are clearly defined, there‚Äôs plenty of action and unexpected turns. The lead character isn‚Äôt the most powerful in the traditional sense, but it‚Äôs her loving essence that gives her power. This movie deserves a sequel because it‚Äôs Covid release really ruined its chances to top box office."
"so underrated, mcu at his best!!"
"Not as bad as Critics claimed but still nothing crazy,good acting and action...just very long and at times boring very forgettable film unfortunately"
"There were characters in this movie that I really liked individually! Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, Richard Madden looks very similar to Sebastian Stan/Bucky, and they could've easily casted someone else to play his role."
""
"The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!"
""
"The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore."
"I wish they explained more about the ‚ÄúEternals,‚Äù I wish they explained more about who they were, individually. I wish that there was more ‚Äústories‚Äù to them after they were separated."
i for one enjoyed it more than many others
Watch if you want‚Ä¶ I didn't care for it much.
It's a special movie.
It was a little slow paced and at the same time tried to do too much with so many new characters but it is a good watch and loved the graphics
"I think this film was marketed incorrectly, instead of being marketed as an action epic, this should have been promoted as a family drama that is comprised of Superheroes."
"I went into this move optimistic but boy was I wrong, this movie was not worth wasting the time seeing literally the worst movie I've ever seen, would rate it a 0 if I could."
I don't know why the critics gave this such a low grade. I loved it. The entire cast is outstanding. It's a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I can't wait until the 2nd one comes out.
This is another great superhero movie. Better storyline and visual effects than Black Panther 2 and Thor 3.
I left the theater when I ran out of popcorn. I was upset with myself for buying the largest size as I had to see almost half of this movie. I never did find out how it ended and I'm fine with that.
Gostei bastante do filme
Was waiting for this movie for some time and wasn't disappointed when I finally got to watch it.
The best part of the movie was the speedster vs the ikarus.
Nice addition to the mcu. Very different from what i‚Äôm used to. Amazing visuals and great cast. Interesting plot.
"By far the worst super hero movie in the last 2 decades.  If this came out in the 90s I think we'd overlook a plot that tried to do way too much with so little.   As it is, it's not even worthy of being in the DC universe."
"Although flawed, this is an entertaining watch with some good performances. The actor playing Druig is the least likeable character so I hope he is a future villain. Perfect creepy villain, shockjing hero. I don't think this is the worst Marvel film, certainly not after Ant Man 3. Enjoyable overall."
"I honestly really enjoyed this film, seeing it in theaters and then seeing the reviews I am still perplexed. Eternals was a solid action movie that leans towards the cosmic bigger entities in the Marvel Universe and really opened the doors to bigger and badder villains to show in the MCU on top of having a fantastic cast. Is it your typical super hero movie? No but they aren't truly super heroes or atleast not meant to be. The villains do fall a bit flat but I think that's the point when you see the whole story. Don't get the hate I'd say give it a watch."
"Interesting characters, uninteresting plot"
Underrated but not great at the same time.
"Big script problems, stereotypical characters and confusion in the ending"
not as good as the others but a good movie
"While I admit that Eternals was visually stunning, the plot left a lot to be desired... especially for fans who are neurodivergent."
"Horrendous movie. Nothing about this movie works. The characters are undeveloped, the plot is confusing and we don't know if the Eternals are heroes or villains. This movie fails in every level of the Marvel formula that has worked for over 10 years."
"Good movie overall, but not worth to watch at movie(g*y guy ruined it)"
"Acho engra√ßado que quando a Marvel faz filme gen√©ricos do estilo Marvel √© criticada, quando arrisca e faz algo diferente tamb√©m. A√≠ fica dificil."
"EU gostei do filme. Est√° longe de ser dos meus favoritos, mas eu curti. O filme tem uma fotografia e um CGI muito lindo. Os personagens no total s√£o legais e eu gostei de ver eles juntos, mas achei que poderiam ter sido mais desenvolvidos. Eu achei que o filme demorou a passar, achei ele bem lentinho, mas curti. A hist√≥ria √© meio confusa, mais mesmo assim √© legal de acompanhar."

"Marvel's Eternals is a serviceable superhero movie, but it's weighed down by its star power and clunky story. The Eternals team consists of otherworldly beings sent to Earth to foster the growth of life and bid never to interfere with the wars of man. Their main purpose is to protect humanity from giant dinosaur-like creatures called deviants who feast on intelligent life. The premise is quite simple, and outside of a couple of twists it never gets more complicated than that, nor does it need to. Instead, the story gets bogged down by its too-numerous cast of characters. These Eternals are a race of immortal beings sent to Earth by an all-powerful Prime Celestial, so why do we as viewers care about who loves whom? It's one of the drivers of conflict throughout the film but between the Eternals not being human and the lack of focus given to any one of them due to time constraints, it might make a viewer roll their eyes. It's not just the overly emotional connections for which the film does little to earn, there's a palpable lack of wisdom for a group who have lived on Earth since the times of Sumerian culture. There exists a strange balancing act in this film between presenting the Eternals as alien and above the fray, but also as human and deeply flawed. Unfortunately those two themes never find a way to mix well together. If one can forgive the pedestrian story driven by lukewarm character building there are good things at play here. First, the acting is solid. The roster is incredible, though overstuffed, and everyone here is certainly capable of handling their role. But no one really stands out either, another unfortunate side effect of cramming too many big names into one film. The special effects and fight choreography are both stunning, with every fight scene cleanly spliced together and every epic bad guy looking real life sharp. The final fight scene alone is probably worth the movie's chunky runtime. But apart from those aspects this film is largely bland, just an A to B story that's built to appear grander than it really is."
for me is a nice movie.
Eternals is the most boring and dull MCU movie of all time.
"An hour shorter and it might have been ok, but falls into the usual marvel trope of overlong never ending action sequences. Just a bit boring at the end of the day"
It‚Äôs only saving grace is its occasional action sequences.
"Chlo√© Zhao's addition to the ever-expanding Marvel universe is a refreshing take on Marvel Studios' classic formula. ‚ÄòEternals' includes a star-studded cast that includes Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani. This latest edition to the MCU is an emotional tale about human connection that features brilliant world-building and an unexpected layer of maturity for a superhero film."
""
"Zhao brings viewers a story that takes place across 7000 years, spanning over a lengthy 157-minute runtime. In fact, the long runtime makes ‚ÄòEternals' the second longest MCU film, coming in 2nd place to the 2019's ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame'. ‚ÄòEternals' features solid performances from its diverse main cast. The film features both Marvel's first deaf superhero (played by ‚ÄòThe Walking Dead's Lauren Ridloff), and the MCU's first openly gay superhero (portrayed by ‚ÄòSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' star Brian Tyree Henry). ‚ÄòEternals' tells the story of an immortal race of superpowered beings, known as Eternals, brought to earth by another race of superpowered beings called Celestials. Sent by the Celestials to rid Earth of creatures called Deviants, the Eternals reside among civilisations throughout our history, helping humanity progress and develop while protecting them from the Deviants. But when they learn the truth of their existence, the Eternals must try and stop the destruction of Earth that has been brought on by an apocalyptic event known as ‚ÄòThe Emergence', an explosive event that follows the birth of a Celestial."
""
"Despite following Marvel's continuously recycled formula, ‚ÄòEternals' manages to inject something new and exciting into the MCU with Zhao's brilliance as a director carrying across into the detailed world-building and Ben Davis' naturalistic cinematography. Zhao also reunited with crew from her 2020 Best Picture winner, ‚ÄòNomadland' cinematographer Joshua James Richards, serving as a camera operator for the film. ‚ÄòEternals' isn't the first film to fall victim to Marvel's current stream of second-rate CGI, recent releases like ‚ÄòShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' and ‚ÄòBlack Widow' have also featured some questionable visual effects. Although, Zhao's unwillingness to use green screen and visual effects allows ‚ÄòEternals' to feature stunning natural locations that bring places like Mesopotamia, Babylon and the Amazon rainforest to the screen. The acclaimed director pays homage to her previous film ‚ÄòNomadland' by including scenes set in South Dakota, as seen in the 2020 drama. ‚ÄòIron Man' and ‚ÄòGame of Thrones' composer Ramin Djawadi returns to Marvel to provide ‚ÄòEternals' with a melodic, pleasant-sounding score."
""
"Like every other Marvel project, the future of the vast universe is hinted at in a variety of ways. ‚ÄòEternals' paves the way for various upcoming projects including Mahershala Ali's upcoming film ‚ÄòBlade and a possible sequel while also introducing new characters like Dane Whitman/Black Knight (played by ‚ÄòGame of Throne's Kit Harington) and Thanos' brother Eros, also known as Starfox (played by none other than Harry Styles). ‚ÄòEternals' deals with more tender themes than some of the other films in the MCU, including human connection, what it means to be human and family. The film also brings an immense amount of diversity to the MCU, including characters of all ages, ethnicities, abilities, and sexualities to the screen. ‚ÄòEternals' marks itself as a turning point for the Marvel universe as the studio is finally acting on it's promise to include characters from all backgrounds and cultures. The film is one of the more mature features to come from Marvel Studios, the film delves into deeper themes than most of Marvel's previous features and the film also includes the MCU's first sex scene, albeit brief enough for the film to keep its 12A/PG-13 rating."
""
"Featuring a star-studded cast and fresh visuals, Chlo√© Zhao's ‚ÄòEternals' is a new, exciting film that shows audiences that superhero films can be cinematic and introspective, while also delivering thrilling fight sequences and intense action. Building on the history of the MCU, and also the future, ‚ÄòEternals' is a tender story that allows viewers from all backgrounds to feel represented and included."
‚ÄòEternals' is an art-house director's film. And it works‚Ä¶ until it doesn't. More: https://bit.ly/3K0Xc3m
"poor casting , poor pacing , poor storyline , kinda dull. i expect more from Marvel to be honest. whoever gave this the green light needs a talking to."
one of my all time favorite marvel movies
""
loved the characters and plot
very overhated because people don't like new things
"Eternals has some fascinating ideas and its ambition, visuals and action sequences are praiseworthy, however it is a drab and tedious movie that doesn't capitulate on its ambition and has uninteresting characters, a poorly executed plot and an overall lack of urgency ultimately making it a disappointing installment in the MCU."
"This movie is boring and has way too many characters shoved into it. I really hope they don't do a sequel, but I appreciate the attempt and the actors trying their best."
The mangled character naming reeks of desperate trademark conflict avoidance with the Greek mythology.
"The story is boring and inconsistent, the dialog is pack full of cheesy lines, but not the funny cheesy kind, the boring cheesy."
I had to watch it in 3 parts because I kept falling asleep.
Angelina looks like a baboon butt with those ridiculous oversized lips.
A very rewatchable MCU movie
Such a good stand alone film.
Holy guacamole that knock of cyclops is lit. Let's go this is the best super hero team yet. Loser you thought avengers were good we'll wait until you see eternals in all of their glory. When I was in the theater I was blessed eternally. The eternals made me feel safe especially one in particular most may know IT as the greatest superhero of all time but I just no IT as master Sprite. Anytime master sprite came on the screen all my fears left me like a hot air balloon into the clouds all my grief and sorrow took flight out of my body like a golden eagle in the sky. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!!!!!! It is too good when I say tooo good I mean tooooooooooooooooo goooooood. I can't get over how graceful Master sprite is it has captivated my mind ever since I left the theatre. I AM A NEW MAN. The MCU will never be the same and this movie is unparalleled by any other movie. Thank you.
"This movie is probably one of the worst Marvel productions the public has seen for quite some time. It's story does not get the details and the time it deserves and it fells a little bit superficial in the way that it leaves most of the main aspects of the comics' story out of the movie. Also the plot feels a little distant from the comics' story as in the comics it mainly focuses on the origins, roles and story of the celestials and in this movie the main focus is on the eternals. Overall it is not a bad movie but it had the potencial to be one of the most interesting stories in the entire MCU."
Good special effects with uninteresting heroes and villans and medicore plot and acting. Average film and too long.
"It's good, I guess. The action is pretty good and the story will definitely excite some people, but it can drag on, and some of the people I really wanted to see more of died too soon."
"A mismatch of cast, characters and plots which did not gel well at all. Overblown with several plots points which started to say something interesting but never actually finished anything. The storyline seems to pander to inclusivity, which overall would be a positive step, however when this comes at the cost of character development it is hard to justify. The humour is misplaced and doesn't land well. Worst of all, at almost 3 hours long it was a slog to get through."
"Good storyline and exciting action. There were a lot of introductions in this MCU edition, which made it complex but similar to many of the other films. I like the diversity of the cast, and references to myths around the world. I never read the comics from old."
"It was Ok. The Main issues are there are too many characters, its unfocused for half the runtime, there is next to no emotion, charm or jokes from any of the acting and really the film lacks a solid identity. There really isn't anything truly broken about it. Everything is passable fundamentally speaking besides the editing. The music is just ok as well. Honestly I'd say watch this only if your a hardcore super hero movie fan. Otherwise its not worth the long run time."
"Underrated movie. Good characters. Great Cinematography. Funny, Cinematic."
"Eternals is breathtaking. Its visuals are beyond stunning, its score excellently reflects the ancient nature of the Eternals, as well as their power and suffering, and the characters are fresh, complex, and unique. The story is essentially the philosophical ""trolley problem"" on a galactic scale, which is a genius idea for an MCU movie. The plot is unpredictable, ever-changing, and every character's motivation is clear, providing for an excellent plot-twist antagonist. However, the deeper themes and complexity of the film seem to have gone over most people's heads."
"It's interesting that Eternals is hated on while similar movies such as ""Dune"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" are praised. All 3 have similar strengths (breathtaking visuals and unique tone) and similar weaknesses (far too much time spent in exposition leading to a long runtime, too many characters to introduce). My theory is that MCU fans decided against this film before it even released, as evidenced by the ""review bombing"" that took place before release date. Yes, the film had a lot of characters to introduce, but a movie can't be simultaneously too packed and too slow, which are the two biggest criticisms Eternals received. Due to the contradicting criticisms, my thoughts are that in reality these fans are more action-oriented as opposed to strength of story."
"Eternals is a film that will grow in popularity over time. Due to its massive, complex nature, the re-watchability is much higher than most MCU films. If you love the film, spread the word. If you didn't love it, I urge you to give it another chance, as its complex story and broken family dynamic allows for an emotional power not common in the MCU."
"Overall, while a new direction to the Marvel universe is welcomed, I'm not sure how I feel about this one. There's plenty of fun to be had, but it requires a bit more work from the viewer than previous Marvel films. It's dialogue-heavy, and, at times, I felt confused by the story and vague new direction. Again, action scenes are fun but generally dark; otherwise, it's a stunning film visually. Eternals is a big change, and the question is, are fans ready? For me, this film certainly warrants a repeat viewing, which I hope will win me over more significantly."
I don't get the hate. I loved this one. Can't wait for the sequel!
"Eternals redefine os filmes de super her√≥i e os eleva,enquanto prepara o que ainda vir√° por a√≠"
It was an amazing movie a little slow but then it picked up the pace a must see I don't see why it's getting all this hate it was amazing show.
Its long but it has some good parts but the red hair girl was soooo bad
"UUUHHH... OK, it's not that bad. It's fine, probably the most mediocre MCU movie of all time. While it's not great, there are a lot of great stuff in it. The cinematography... Chefs kiss 3!! Kingo and his cameraman are hilarious and easily carry the movie. To the bad, i guess. The story is so lackluster, as there are no stakes in a end-of-the-world story, especially if it's in a cinematic universe with other movies releasing afterwards. None of the characters, except for Kingo, are so bland and uninteresting and it doesn't really make sense that the mute person does sign-language and points on her wrist, like a wristwatch, which doesn't exist in the caveman era when she does it. I went on a tangent there, oops! Fine action, fine character. Yeah Idk, it's just a really bland movie."
"another instantly forgettable marvel movie that looks like a minimum effort by all involved, quality, not quantity is what the audience wants"
Nice photography but the movie himself is boring and you do not fill any empathy for the characters.
One of the weakest Marvel movies... Tons of potential for MCU growth but fell flat. No mention of the heroes in other Marvel movies either yet... so it seemed extremely at random that they would release this movie. Easily could have connected things with Guardians of the Galaxy but they decided to introduce a blip preface to the Marvel vampire stuff...
This is a great film and deserves a sequel just bravo.
"O filme em minha opini√£o e um dos melhores da atual faze, claro ficando apenas uma posi√ß√£o atr√°s de Wakanda Forever! Tem personagens interessantes e uma nova equipe que pode ser explorada ainda mais nos futuros filmes."
Absolutly the worst Marvel film in history
"Beautifully shot, with characters that are a lot more personable than their comic book counterparts. Not enough time to get to them all well, but I hope we see more of them."
"Me encant√≥! Deseando ver m√°s de estos personajes. Disfrut√© con todo de esta pel√≠cula. Desde la fotograf√≠a, gui√≥n, actores,... ¬°TODO! He escuchado criticas a lo lenta que le pareci√≥ a muchas personas, puede ser cierto que lleva otro ritmo a lo que Marvel Studios nos tiene acostumbrados, yo agradezco que se tomen el tiempo y la delicadeza de otorgarle personalidad propia a cada proyecto. Eternals es una joya dentro de toda la filmograf√≠a de Marvel."
The slowest Superhero film ever made. Eternals is convoluted and lacks the deep dive into character that is needed to pull off this kind of film. At least it is more interesting than Nomadland.
"One of Marvel's best underrated movies, Marvel decided to change itself for the better.  This is a beautiful film, which speaks to adults and not to children.  The movie shows Marvel from a different point of view, I've seen many Marvel movies but this movie made me think.  The main problem with the film is that Marvel was afraid to pull it, in my opinion the film was supposed to be three hours.  The characters in the film are simply fascinating, but it is difficult to contain them because of the length of the film and in general the film is supposed to be a series."
"Eternals is the most beautiful Marvel movie ever. It's just set apart from others. Every character, every move, and action is terrific. The plot line has a nice twist in the end. Every cast is accurately cast, for example, Angelina Jolie is perfect for playing Thena. And the design of the costumes and CGI powers are artistic and different from any other Marvel movie."
"And the most important thing is this movie is very promising, it opened up a different genre and a bigger storyline and plan for upcoming movies"
"Terrible, absolutely terrible! worst movie ever! how dare you destroy Kirby's work like this! life will punish you guys"
I hope their story continues to show new adventures as well. The final action scenes are amazing.
"Not horrible, just not particularly good. Too many forgettable and unlikable people/characters, and all embroiled in a terribly generic plot."
Meu filme favorito do MCU ü¶Ñü§©üôÉ
Not the non-stop goofy good time you get from most Marvel films. I am flexible though. It has a good cast and fine rock song choices. Not close to the best Marvel film. Yet I can‚Äôt talk myself into being a hater. It‚Äôs a guilty pleasure.
"Maybe the sequel or whatever movie they make next with these characters in it will make this one better, but it just felt like it dragged. It was scattered at times and hard to follow. Hopefully they expand on Eros in an upcoming film as well as the rest of the characters. I was hoping for more but all in all it was mediocre at best."
"While not your standard addition to the MCU, this film is better than it's given credit for. The production is amazing, the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the scope of the Celestials is captured perfectly, a few of the characters are genuinely likable and Ramin Djawadi once again provides a wonderful score."
One of the best comic movies created! I don't understand how the critics gave such a low score on this one while on other crap super hero movies and series like She Hulk and Thor Love and Thunder gave a much better one! I don't think you know what you are doing anymore! Hopefully the eternals will be combined in the future story of marvel.
"One of the best MCU movies, well integrated in this world and interesting for his cosmic future!"
Definitely my least favorite of the marvel movies. Just was not very good.
"This defiantly would have worked a lot better as a Disney+ series. It was a little boring in quite a few places and there were a few plot points that I thought could have done with refining, but it was alright."
"This film isn't for everyone. However, for me, I appreciate the bold decisions made by the director."
Worst Marvel film ever.
"Felt like Captain America Civil War to me with the characters fighting amongst themselves, but the story is decent and the action is solid, and with a twist at the end, Marvel is in a new darker direction that should leave audiences wondering what's next for the MCU?"
The movie is bland and uninteresting
Chole zao didn't knew what kind of movie she wanted to make. The movie was struggling between Diving into the past which didn't have any gold in it(was not interesting) and also in the present it's hard to focus on one person which was gema chans character as with every 20 mins they were introducing characters again and again and was reintroducing the plot in different way in every 30 mins . The villain was ehhhhhhh and wasn't developed and the villain looked like lots of cable mixed in a drawer. The best character and acting  belong to Kit harrington in this movie
"A watershed, but for me it was an interesting film. Seeing a group of heroes come together again made me happy, little action, but enough and beautiful CGI."
"Probably one of the slowest mcu movies.  Copious back stories and pacing make the movie feel really slow.  Looked beautiful though.  The most interesting character flew himself into the sun, making any sequel look even less inspiring."
For 11/2021:
Marvel Studios presents their next big team of superheroes
"Directed by Chloe Zao she assembles a very rich, diversified cast in this long roster"
After Thanos wiped out half the universe and Tony Stark bringing everyone back due to his sacrifice it provided the necessary energy to create an event called the Emergence; basically this would wipe the slate clean on planet Earth for other worlds to exist
"7,000 years ago beings called Eternals gifted with immortality and amazing powers arrived from the planet Olympia or did they?; they were instructed to not interfere with human history or conflicts by Celestials unless creatures called Deviants were involved"
"The Eternals comprise of 5 fighters and 5 thinkers; Ikaris who can fly, shoot beams from his eyes, and have superhuman strength, Makkari who has super speed and is deaf, Thena the goddess of war who can create all kinds of weapons, Sersi who can manipulate matter, Druig who can control people's minds, Kingo who's a Bollywood star but more joking than anyone that can fire projectiles from his hands, Phastos who can control any type of technology, Ajak who can heal people, Gilgamesh who can deliver super powered punches, and Sprite who can create illusions"
"Even though they've shaped our cultures and civilizations since the dawn of time it's a heavy burden for them all they couldn't lift a finger to help humanity, heck they even explain why they didn't help the Avengers"
Now with the Emergence on the rise these immortal warriors have to band together to protect what they now hold dear even going against their prime directive
"Kros, is one their many obstacles being in charge of the Deviants making them believe they can't protect humans next to Jemiah the Analyzer who created the Eternals and Arishem, their master"
It's the 3rd longest MCU entry next to 'Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame' but still good for fans that have been keeping with this franchise since 2008; brings all the enjoyment you'd expect albeit minor flaws included
It takes some getting used to the exposition
"But the action is impressive, love the big world building, this rich diverse cast, the costumes, and it opens more of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in multiple directions"
Love this musical score too
"Ajax is the almighty leader yet she can't let anyone interfere with human history lest them hindering their natural evolution, Kingo is the funny comic relief with his Bollywood personality, Sprite is the free youthful spirit being that she's stunted in her growth being an immortal teenager, Sersi is the heart of the group feeling she used to have a romance with Ikkaris, Thena is the fierce warrior sticking to her duties yet she's feeling weak with her memories since she's been around for eons, Druig wishes everyone should have a common ground, Gilgamesh is the calming one for Thena, and Phastos feels ashamed of his tinkering considering how humans have used machines to kill each other so he's found human connection living a domestic life"
This entry is more dramatic than bombastic or cartoony which might not sit well with many;
villains are kinda lame to be honest with Kro only being in here for 5 min and Arishem who's kinda sitting in the background
It stinks 2 characters in here are axed off quick being part of this main family
"A lot of the environments feel empty and boring since it's a lot of deserts, oceans, grass fields, beaches and volcanoes"
"Still, it does show how others involved with humanity's development would've shifted things allowing us to evolve, thrive, learn from our mistakes"
Human nature is what it is; sometimes it's unavoidable or not our place to change what has to unfold
Without our flaws and mistakes we couldn't stand out or learn to be better
"Chloe Zhao knows her characters and their interpersonal relationships, she has them dig deep into themselves about whether they should do more than what they were made for or not bother getting attached to a planet inhabited"
It's definitely a heavy toll being immortal and having to watch over civilizations far slower than others as far as weapons and modern technology
One of those rare superhero films to make the viewer think
The casting here is also a true profession of representation in film
The mid credits scene is crazy and the after credits scene....very ambiguous
It's a lot of mystery for the future to unfold that's for sure
25 movies in and Marvel Studios is still showing their love and passion for an ever-expanding multitude of stories from the pages of the comics
This one isn't perfect and will be very divisive but you can tell they are trying to open more doors for further adventures and that's fine by me as a comic book movie lover
Better than expected.
"I hate this movie, I'm just giving it 1 star because of the visual experience, if it wasn't for that, it will be a half star, i don't recommend"
"THIS MOVIE IS EXTREMELY UNDERRATED AND ""OVER HATED"" , I don't see any reasons to hate this film this much , Chole Zhao have directed this film so well it's beautiful and having the best CGI , Plot Twist , Sound effects better than any of the others phase 4 movies and shows"
""
The direction is good
Almost all actors gave their best
VFX and CGI is TOP NOTCH
Twist is good
Story telling is good but a little complex when you will watch it for the first time because you have to pay attention at some scenes that are important
""
"Movie feels a little bit lengthy , some part of the movie like Jumping back from present to future and then again'present felt not perfect"
""
""
""
"Overall , Eternals is a amazing , beautiful movie"
"No matter what the critics and the people say, Eternals is an absolutely beautiful film. It makes you feel things more then any other Marvel movie has,. The cinematography is PEAK and the visuals are absolutely EYE- CATCHING, and as the cherry on top, the suits of the characters are FABULOUS. The story falls short, but once you get over it, it is a soulful and awakening adventure."
Worst movie ever marvel has been doing a terrible job on movies after endgame nothing feels like the mcu
"Eternals is the most ambitious film to date in the history of the MCU, and takes the franchise to another level with Gods, immortals and magic, we are not in the old MCU anymore. Unfortunately casual fans of the franchise will leave the film scratching their head with all of the  ""inside baseball"" content and lore that will probably go over the head of most people but hardcore fans will sure to get a kick out of where the franchise is headed."
"I could manage my patience  with so many characters without any solid link to real MARVELS  until ""politically correctness"" and sexuality was grossly evident. I quit and at the middle of the movie. This is a rotten one..."
Very good and deep film. MCU's Mythology and it is great diracted. Unfortunate that Marvel doesn't want to be loved for its content..
"A decent movie but eternally boring at times. Eternals is movie that makes me happy for the convenience of streaming. Many of the exposition scenes in this movie are near unbearable. The stars on the screen do not share much chemistry which is surprising after spending nearly 5000 years together. This is a typical action movie Marvel movie. Nameless uninspired grey monsters attack Earth for the majority of the movie. I did enjoy some of the action scenes, though many of the character powers are very ""one note"", and quickly become predictable and boring. On a personal note I am kinda bummed Marvel is leaning heavily into magic now rather than a good mix of scifi. This makes it difficult to gauge just how powerful these beings are. I would say unless you're a die hard fan of the lore watch the action scenes and read a synapsis online. You would think a movie with a character near Ikarus would be a bit more willing to take risks, sadly this movie never makes it off the ground."
"Have potential, but why the hell they downgraded them so much? They barely can win vs some big lizards xD"
"What a waste of time. Confused, stupid, and cheap looking. This doesn't even feel like a Marvel movie."
Not as bad as some people say. But it's just meh.
"Not the worst film MCU has put out but not the best either. I enjoyed it nonetheless, the conclusion was fun too. Obviously the CGI has it's moments here and MCU starting to slow down as they push their CGI to it's furthest limits."
I liked the story and how the characters were depicted each with their own features. The action scenes are breathtaking.
Eternals is a good movie. The visual effects are amazing and very well done. I hope their story continues.
"Eternals was not well received when released, so I put off seeing it for quite some time.  It exceeded my expectations by quite a bit."
"I can see the difficulty that critics had.  There are ten Eternals, so it takes a while to get to know each of them and what role they play in the movie.  But the characters are well differentiated and interesting, and Gemma Chan does a good job tying them altogether as our protagonist."

"The story itself is of course ridiculous, but so what?  The MCU keeps scaling up to encompass more and more of the comic book history.  We started with Iron Man and Captain America, scaled up with the Asgardians, scaled up again with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos, and Captain Marvel, and the step to the story line of the Eternals is one level even higher.  At some point one has to wonder how the various levels can possibly mesh together (this is where the multiverse provides many outs), but let's not forget the primary purpose is to tell enjoyable stories.  This particular story works well."
"It took 3 attempts to get through this movie. The inventor was an interesting choice for superpowers. The gunslinger though, not bagging on the actor, that was lazy writing."
Another weak and absolutely boring Marvel movie. A complete waste of time ...
"Too many characters, not enough time to develop them all and get me to have any emotional connection to them."
"love it, good CG, good cast, amazing director"
"L movie, L writing, L characters"
The more powerful mcu movie
unwatchable
boring empty and repetitive dialogues
bad acting
"The cast, score, and comic book origin of the Eternals doesn't truly get to shine through in this film, however the characters and casting are it's saving grace."
Mediocre & convoluted.
"After Endgame, Marvel has continued to get worse, and I can 100% say this is the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen."
"Given the mixed reviews, I was apprehensive about seeing this film but it turned out to be a rather impressive entry to the MCU - both visually and narratively. I appreciate it's not the typical MCU story but that's refreshing!"
Worst mcu movie ever.
Normally I Love Marvel Super Hero movies. This one did not do it for me.
worst mcu movie ever
"This was just a very bad movie. Horribly structured and constructed. It took 2 hours just to sort of introduce all of the characters and ""get the band back together"" and then the story was just trying to be way too big and cosmic. Honestly, just a very bad movie."
"An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing -- and occasionally confounding -- new directions."
"Its above average, i think the characters are ok, i think the story also is ok, visuals are great, acting is decent, story is decent. The action was good and the ending was decent."
I still don't know what was the point.  It's just hard to be invested in the outcome with these characters.
Casting->2.5
Characters->1
Character Development->1.5
Story->1.5

"I don't understand why critics are against this movie. It was something new, something we are not used to, something incredible... The cast for the film with personalities like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Richard Madden do fantastic in their roles, endowing the characters they play with charisma and personality. The film has inclusive characters that do not feel forced, as is the case in most current proyects. It is not the typical superhero movie, moral and ethical issues are touched, who are the good guys and their own creation are questioned. The film does not hesitate for a second to put an end to any of the characters that could be of potential benefit to the franchise. This phase of Marvel I feel is darker, more adult, and daring more..."
"This wasn't good at all. I didn't hate it, it was just was all over the the place and lack writing cohesiveness. Not sure why the score is like this."
i didnt see one good thing in this
"It is a different movie, but it still felt ad part of the mcu formula. Combining so many plot points and so many characters made it suffer, but it is still very enjoyable and a bit different."
Could have been better.

Too many characters with not enough time to connect and care about any of them.
"A little slow and meandering, but introspective and exostential and makes you ponder on the beauty and pain associated with humanity."
Plot made little sense. Characters lacked depth. Editing and plot made little sense.
Good to watch at least once but that was enough for me.
"In 5000 BC, ten superpowered Eternals‚ÄîAjak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena‚Äîare sent by the Celestial Arishem to Earth on their starship, the Domo, to exterminate the invasive Deviants. The last Deviants are apparently killed in 1521, when the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders. In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman who works at the Natural History Museum. When the trio are attacked by the Deviant Kro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem. Sersi learns that the mission of the Eternals was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting the seeds of Celestials inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when the Deviants evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the reversal of the Blip,[N 2] Earth has reached the necessary population for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth's destruction. Hoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reconvene. At Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with his mind-control powers. However, Ikaris reveals that Ajak told him of the Emergence centuries before. When Ajak told him she wishes to stop the Emergence, he led her to the Deviants who killed her..."

"Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing‚Äîand occasionally confounding‚Äînew directions."" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard described the film as ""lavish"" and ""ambitious"", and praised the fight sequences as ""astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail"". Robert Abele of TheWrap commended the cinematography and felt ""an earnestness to the operatic stakes"". Oliver Jones of the Observer called it ""full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own"". Owen Gleiberman was disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020) to ""embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking"", but felt that the film was a ""squarely fun and gratifying watch"". Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times thought ""it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant"". Linda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle described it as ""a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances""; Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture called Zhao's direction ""workmanlike""; and Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent said that it ""strives for the same expansive soulfulness"" as Nomadland ""but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it"". Brian Lowry of CNN thought ""the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances"". Kyle Smith of National Review was harsher, describing it as ""one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human"" of the MCU films. The mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that ""much of the criticism of Kirby's work"", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the wider Marvel Universe, ""has followed Zhao in her adaptation."" He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe films Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), writing that they and Eternals share ""a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending."" This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly. Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone ""having an existential crisis"" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an ""existential crisis, both for humanity and God"". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were ""a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel""."

"Based on Jack Kirby¬¥s classic and slightly surreal comic, this film struggles with a mixed bag of characters and a partly stiff and wobbly performance from the main actors. The development of who the Eternals are, is more of less non existing and the running time is too long with several scenes that could¬¥ve been edited down as they just drag. I also think that the film uses too much of a humorous approach that doesn¬¥t work at all. My other criticism is as well that Marvel and Chlo√© Zhao haven¬¥t manage to adapt Jack Kirby¬¥s comic in a convincing way to the silver screen. The CGI is pretty nice though and there¬¥s still some entertainment value in this film. However, ""Eternals"" will get a sequel, but who honestly want to see that?"

"Trivia: The film grossed $402 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its themes and visuals, but criticized its screenplay, pacing, runtime, and character development."
"Eternals was not as bad as I had feared. It is a ""C"" movie. Not great, but not terrible either. It's just completely meh.  Just like my thoughts and energy spent on this review."
"All of human history... And NOTHING happens? A BUNCH of characters and you don't really see any of them..... A 2 and a half hour, ""superhero"" movie and it did nothing... Not much else to say."
"Nomadland was the only movie of 2020 that I couldn't watch. The fact that she won awards at every festival she attended and that she won an Oscar on top of it reinforced my interest in the film. However, the movie I watched when I had the opportunity was a kind of meditation that brought worse sleep than medicine, no matter how well-intentioned it was. There are very few movies that I get bored with watching. I was quite surprised to hear that the director who shot this boring masterpiece would be directing a Marvel movie. There shouldn't be anything as ironic as a superhero film by a director who takes Terrance Malick as an example. So I ended my review of the movie I wrote for the √ñteki Sinema with these sentences: ""I really wonder what kind of superhero movie the director, whose narration style led me to siesta, prepared. Again, if she envies Malick's cinema, she will either make the most boring superhero movie ever made or make a revolution in this field"". Did it revolutionize? I do not think so. But she is likely to be a pioneer. Of course, although she made a much more dynamic film than I thought, it is obvious that she signed a completely different approach compared to the remaining 25 films in the series. Eternals is an entirely different Marvel movie, both in terms of directing and scenario approach; It is one of the rare examples that succeeded in presenting the philosophical approach sought in the superhero world."
"Great origin entry MCU Marvel Cinematic Universe film with lots of great scenes, memorable characters, charming story and intriguingly great use of misremembered encounters in the human timeline. It's a fantastic film, as many Marvel films are. A few things that let it down are characters that were great on screen were cut out to early, a lot of dialogue that wasn't really clear nor relative to the plot (which could of been easily left out) and unnecessarily too long in some scenes. Regardless, it's still a great film to watch as is. An engaging film with various plot twists, locations and memorable characters and intriguing storytelling."
"Enjoyed the twist, representation and the action scenes. It is also marvellous how they used mythology in it."

"Eternos peca na hora de apresentar novos personagens e construir suas identidades e motiva√ß√µes, isso deixa o filme um pouco raso e cansativo de assistir. A fotografia √© perfeita e os efeitos especiais de longe s√£o um dos melhores j√° apresentado pela Marvel, mas √© apenas isso o que salva esse filme."
I enjoyed the movie. It was a nice break form the typical MCU movie.
"1 hour too long. Typical of Marvel movies, has its funny moments."
"Vacant and trying too hard. There was no chemistry between the actors, so it never felt real. Clearly, we're supposed to leave the theater filled with an urgent sense of anticipation, but all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end."

"ALSO: No one, and I mean no one is going to find some average fat guy believable as an ""Eternal""."
"The year 2021 began with the Marvel Cinematic Universe falling upon an established character with Black Widow getting her movie and then trying something new in Shang-Chi. Both movies were phenomenal and now the MCU continues with another new addition to the film universe in the Eternals, a Marvel series of immortal alien demigods. I have heard some mention from fans of the Marvel comics, especially hinting at their relationship with the supervillain Thanos. I don't read many Marvel comics, but I have a general knowledge of their more famous characters with the Eternals being a complete mystery to me, but I came into this with an open mind, and I have to admit that I was not just disappointed but bored out of my mind."
""
"The planet Earth has existed for thousands of years and in that time, it has been watched over by immortal demigods known as the Eternals. These beings watch over life on the planet but only as observers, choosing to help humanity but not advance them to their level. These dozen beings of great power, wisdom, and intelligence are amazing presences that appear to be well-meaning but over the years of existence, they have maintained power but with limitations. But they are not all-powerful and are guarded by even greater beings known as Celestials who have a special mission in mind for Earth as the Eternals protect the planet from only a specific threat. But the Eternals learn of what the Celestials have in mind, and it sends the rest of the Eternals at odds, especially against each other."

"I heard someone describe this as an Ancient Aliens movie set for the Marvel Universe in a similar style to epics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but that was a good strong drama, this is a tedious bore. These are comic book movies, and they are supposed to be fun, but this movie was not. It was slow and boring and should never have been made. With performances that were weaker than the plot and special effects that were just as poor. Probably the worst time I spent in a theater."
worst marvel movie ever.
I understand why it's not popular..... no STUPID Marvel Jokes. I enjoyed it
"This is a bad MCU movie not the worst I personally think Thor, Ant Man & The Wasp, Thor The Dark World & Incredible Hulk are worse. This film is really over stuffed with too many things there are too many characters so the movie can't balance everyone out properly if they cut it down to just 5 Eternals rather than 10 it would have worked better since each member has a interesting story like Phasto's when he arrives at the Nagasaki bombing seeing how his influence indirectly causing Death & Mayhem, Athena seeing her past memories rather than having a illness that Celestials get & Druig taking a more pacifist role during human evolution after seeing a lot of war & genocide among the humans. If there is any MCU property that should have gotten a Disney + show it should have been this it could have easily been 2 seasons long & it would have fleshed out the group & the lore way better since a lot of things go unexplained or are ignored since it has too many things to explain to us with only a 2 hours & 37 minutes run time."
"Filling in the remains gaps in MCU watching, seeing this at some remove from cinematic release does allow some for some perspective. While the plot and the screenplay are all over the place and some VFX lack physical weight, there are some nice visual moments and directorial touches. But as the significantly overlong running time bites, the negatives take hold - and the fact that there are too many new characters to really care about means it drags way too much. Not awful, but not that good either."
My least favorite Marvel movie yet.
"""Let's make a movie, not a show, about 10 completely new characters that almost nobody has ever heard about. Let's also kill off 4 of them, give only 1 or 2 of them any character development whatsoever. Oh, and let's also have the movie span thousands of years."""
Clearly a good idea. Poor writing. Acceptable acting. Decent CGI. Horrible story. Horrible pacing. Unlikeable characters. And the romance that wasn't even supposed to be in the movie was cuter and felt stronger than the literally plot point that was Sersi and Icarus.
"Terrible Marvel movie, but not the worst Marvel project."
This movie was alright. The several main characters introduced in one movie was not the greatest idea as the audience couldn't find any personal connections to any of them. It was a bold idea by Marvel to create a film like this in the MCU but was not the greatest outcome. There was also very poor pacing throughout the film. One thing I liked was that it did not seem like a typical marvel superhero film which shows some growth within the company.
"""Eternals"" is an ambitious and visually stunning film that takes the Marvel Cinematic Universe to new heights. While Gemma Chan's lead role may not have been as commanding as I would have hoped, the rest of the cast shines, with standout performances from Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani. The film's visuals are simply breathtaking, with epic set pieces and stunning action sequences that showcase the incredible scope and scale of the story. While the film's pacing may have suffered a little from its ambitious storytelling, ""Eternals"" still manages to deliver a compelling and entertaining adventure that is sure to delight ."
"For a movie that aims to be one of the greatest Marvel is really far from that... It's not like you will spend a bad time watching this movie but the main issue with it is the pace. Multiple times the film will get exciting but then spoil the tension by giving you a flashback or a long conversation, also the lack of bright light/colors contributes to make the movie looks duller than it is. The story (not the script) of Eternals is by far the best part, the characters have to face very complex situations in a cosmic-level but also in a deep human-level. The only issue here is that we have complex quandaries with not-that-complex characters. I won't say that the characters are clich√© or one-note but they lack the depth needed by the storyline. The actors playing the two main characters fail to give charism or chemistry to their eternal beings... it's especially visible when you have Angelina Jolie succeeding in all of that with Don Lee and with the (surprising) few amount of screen time and dialogue she has."
Beautiful cinematography and just a wonderful introduction to these new Marvel characters. Chole Zhao is amazing and excited to see more of her in the MCU.
"I really wanted to like this movie but they failed on so many levels. The story was weak, the writing was horrendous and they played identity politics...the box office numbers don't lie"
"This is very much a film of its type - a Marvel CGI fest. There are a lot of characters and a lot of story but it didn't really grab me. I'm not too keen on most of these films yet Chloe Zhao (the director) is one of my favourite directors, so that piqued my interest. Angelina Jolie and Gemma Chan certainly give credible performances but this film felt too long drawn out and a little cliched for my liking. I wouldn't recommend it as such, no."
It's good not unwatchable.
"Just awful, one of the main characters leaves for no reason before the big battle, monsters so bad. Whole thing really poor."
"Despite its inclusive cast and its director, Eternals is still a bland, boring movie that fails in the most important thing: entertaining the audience."
This isn't really my kind of movie
"can a marvel movie get any worse, we have yet to see . . ."
"This movie's greatest sins were that it seemed pointless, and it was boring."
"It's not She-Hulk bad, but it is awful. The cool visuals and decent acting from most of the cast couldn't carry the bad writing and terribly planned marvel movie."
"I found this movie to be longer than it needed to be. The lifestyle of the characters felt forced upon the viewer. I think this movie is a little bit on the ""woke""side. A big letdown for a Marvel movie."
"Beautifully shot movie, wish it tied into the MCU more‚Ä¶we know sequel will"
"hit the nail on the head with that ""perfectly"" bridled potential vibe."
It's a comic book movie mixed with a philosophy book. Very interesting!!!
CGI quality and acting are good points of this movie but the story is weak and so far we haven't seen the impacts that the movie leaves on the Marvel universe.
"Ca≈Çkiem ok, ale g≈Ç√≥wna bohaterka do b√≥lu nijaka i nudna, od razu zapomina siƒô o jej istnieniu"
Absolutely horrible!
This movie just didn't make me feel invested in the Eternals. The visuals were quite outstanding but weren't enough to win me over.
Worst MCU movie to date.
"Neat, the worst superhero movie I've seen in the last decade or so. This was a snoozefest, predictable and boring the whole way through."
"An absolutely abysmal dumpster fire of a film. It is boring, it is cliche, and worst of it all makes zero sense whatsoever in the greater part of the MCU, especially since every film prior and post this one ignores the absolutely world-changing events of its plot. At least ""The Blip"" gets acknowledgement."
"Too many character for the director to juggle and all the hype of, ""inclusivity,"" and ""saving lives,"" appears to be just that, hype. It didn't make this horrific film any better, in fact, this film isn't worth the two hours it takes to watch it. Spending two hours doing practically anything else will enrich your life more than this film ever could."
Disney Marvel is just churning out content in hopes that people will see it.
Marvel fan but sorry this is too much of the push. You pushed the cultures / customs too much and made it suck!!
"boring, not even one character was likable."
The directing and acting is so bad
"Most overhated and underrated MCU film ever, really beautiful and philosophical! Worth a watch if you ask me!"
"Overall boring and too ambitious, lack of interesting characters and a script filled with plot holes."
4/10
Worst product from Phase 4 of the MCU so far
It was long and tiring :( and the antagonist became useless with Ikaris turning into the main bad guy and I didn't find that as a good idea.
"I thought the movie was a little LACKLUSTER to put it mildly.. But then again, the comic books are pretty dry too (which is odd considering the premise)... The movie had way too many characters that needed introduced, fleshed out, torn apart, and brought together ALL in one film!! This is not including the ""antagonists"". (yes, plural) which really aren't touched on much.... All in all, it had great ambition, but ultimately told a rather dull, super show that kinda-sorta spanned ALL RECORDED history(without showing much of any of it).... So that's actually somewhat impressive I guess."
"Eternals was awesome one of the better mcu movies. It's a movie that gets away from the comedy and silliness that most of these mcu movies offer. Probably why it's rated so low by many. I loved the tone of it, I hope they make the x-men movies like this and less like Thor, ant man, and guardians of the galaxy. Great story telling, great characters, and a beautiful looking movie. Definitely looking forward to part 2. Eternals will be huge in the mcu going forward especially with the x-men in the future."
"Eternals really stands on its own, in a good way, compared to other Marvel movies. Felt fresh and original. The plot in many ways is very different from the ""generic MCU character introduction movie"". The characters were great, story was great, bit slow at some points but it really got me going for the whole movie. Cast and acting was good, scenery and cgi were awesome aswell. Honestly, got really surprised when I saw the amount of negative reviews (mostly from critics). Really recommend the movie!"
"I don't understand how anyone can watch this seriously. The implications this film brings to the MCU are monstrous and overlooked at the same time. Way too many characters that I do not care for at all. Quite sadly, the worst Marvel movie to date."
"The characters, the actors were excellent. The story was a bit slow and took some time to get moving, but it picked up strongly at the end. I do wonder how the MCU will respond to having a planetary-sized statue sticking out of the Earth - will it become the next greatest tourist attraction or will they ignore it completely? It left more than a few questions, especially with the Celestials stepping in at the end."
"It is a ""Meh, it passed the time"" indeed.   Yes, it is not the typical Marvel and I liked that, but the script or the pace were a bit off, or maybe it was some of the characters / actors were not cast properly.  Or maybe a combination of both. Feels dull at times. Love the concept and the beginning of the movie thou. There is plenty of room for improvement I think."
"If you like watching paint dry, this is the movie for you. Slow and boring with nothing to redeem it. Disney has ruined the Marvel movies. This is probably the last movie in the Marvel chain that I'll ever watch."
I have no idea why ppl were complaining about this movie. I loved it. it's great movie. Worth watching.
Why is the movie so hated? for me it's a good historic movie 6.3/10
"Average Marvel movie.  I like much of it, though it was kind of blah.  Much better than End Game."
"When I go to see an MCU movie I expect to see super heros saving the world, not a sad emotional film about borderline normal people falling in love. it was more about diversity than having a plot at all"
"I completely loved the movie. Characters are all very likeable. Clash of motives is well executed. One of the villains lacks depth though. His motive is clear but lacks depth to it. Movie is thrilling, effects very well executed, story is gripping and at times you feel like the characters are actually in danger. Some movies u just know they finna b alright cuz plot armor. They kinda destroyed that concept here which is a good thing regarding cinematography, the way its executed is sad but in a high quality movie kinda way. Highly recommend, lookin forwards to the next movie."
An enjoyable movie but not anything I'd watch again.
"Thank you Chloe Zhao for ruining what could've been the coolest Phase 4 Marvel movie. If Disney offers you to direct a sequel, please don't....just don't"
One of the worst marvel movies. Why Kevin? Why?
Very good movie if it wasn't trying to connect with the marvel universe.  Just feel like it was forced into existence.
boring af the plot was too slow
Personally don't even think this movie is that bad to be honest but something that I do agree with is that it's on the lower side of the MCU.
Went into this with low expectations and was still disappointed. Would not recommend
"Eternals is exceptional but some flaws , but it pushes the MCU into promising new territory....it feels like an amalgam of what Marvel does best - splendidly chaotic fight scenes, dazzling special effects, and stories that speak to who we are as human beings."
"Eternals is exceptional but does has some flaws , but it pushes the MCU into promising new territory....it feels like an amalgam of what Marvel does best - splendidly chaotic fight scenes, dazzling special effects, and stories that speak to who we are as human beings."
"If you kill off your best character within the first like what‚Ä¶ 15 minutes? if his screen time, then you know you messed up. Gilgamesh was BY FAR the best character of the movie, and they killed him off. Waste of time, I'd rather watch my grandfather carve logs for a day. At least better than Ms. Marvel as a whole though. It had ambition, but it went overboard and too far to reach their limits."
""
Eternals Rating: E for Eternal Disappointment.
"A ""just OK"" entry in the MCU that has some impressive moments (a great brawl on a beach to go with some stunning location shooting), but is far too long as suffers from a mild version of ""Suicide Squad"" malaise (too many new characters so you don't really care about any them)."
It was just as bad as the Incredible Hulk
Bad. Just bad from start to finish. There‚Äôs almost no character development. I did not care what happened to anyone by the end of the film. They introduced the celestials and have a world ending event which does not even draw the attention of the remaining avengers. I feel like they are ultimately going to dump this film as a one off that failed miserably.
"I mean, Karun is the most interesting character in the movie. This should tell you a lot. And the fact that the actress portraying Sersi was in Captain Marvel as a different character confused me a lot."
"Stunning visuals and beautiful score. Notable performances from the cast. While having pacing issues and excessive exposition at times, it is an underrated and unappreciated gem, and a breeze of fresh air for the MCU. Hopefully, over time, shall be considered as one of the strongest entries of Phase 4."
The movie was good. I liked that there was a significant amount of actual story and plot and not just a bunch of mindless action. I think some people did not have an adequate attention span perhaps. Hope to see a continuation of the story for the Eternals.
"One of the absolute worse movies ever. A disgrace to all the movies in the Marvel Universe. Story, characters, etc. just horrible. Please do not waste your time."
A modern super heroes movie unlike any other block buster
"INCREDIBLE!! this movie is very underrated, it doesn't deserve the hate it received, it's a work of art."
"I would litterally give it zero stars if it was possible. Horrible movie. This MCU phase four is succesfully destroying everything that was so beloved to comic fans. Shame, but it was great while it lasted."
(Spoilers) Jolie strangely under utilized - character one-dimensional as are all characters.
Inclusion felt forced.
Gemma Chan and Richard Madden's acting were maddeningly wooden.
"Character's choices are not rational.  Kingo leaving the group for the 3rd act was lame.  Sprite literall back stabbed Sersi but was instantly forgiven.  The resolution of the movie was not satisfactory.  The script stinked.  Oh, also there was an ""The Notebook"" element in this.  Disgusting."
"Why was this movie so literally dark - I had to crank up brightness to the max to barely even see what was happening. Other than that, it was just terrible anyways. I felt like a masochist just attempting to finish watching the movie."
"Certain Marvel movies are turning into filler movies, like filler scenes."
"This film left me bewitched, bothered and bewildered  . . ."
My rating for the film is a 6.3/10
"What a disaster of a film. I came into the movie, expecting to see something nice, exciting, funny, and enjoyable, like all the other Marvel movies come to be. But no, I came out of the theater, feeling as though roughly three hours of my life was flushed down the toilet. I never expected to have this be one of the worst films that I have even seen, but it turned out the way. Wow, Marvel, just wow...."
""
"At the beginning of my endeavor, I was sort-of entertained. I liked the aspect of an interesting, superhero team, because I like when people introduce more people, new people, into a universe, so I was excited. It's still better than changing your entire pre-existing characters to be more inclusive. I liked it. It was fine. Not the best, but not the worst, either. I thought the entire movie was going to have that tone. It felt like a Marvel movie. But what I ended up getting felt more, well, DC, which would have been fine, except I hate long(er) DC movies, because I've known where they've come down to (Man of Steel, Batman Vs Superman), and it did not disappoint... down to the examples of MOS and BVS, which are bad movies that I hate.  But that was about the first 10-20 minutes...."

"After the scene in the city, my hopes weren't that high, but not THAT low either. This movie exceeds at one thing only; boredom and copying down other ideas that films prior had used. This whole movie, after the city scene, felt like a scrap yard, turning already-used things, and making something else out of it (and was the quality of a scrap yard too), which is usually fine, but they did it in such a way where it just felt like a ""Hey, can I copy your homework,"" sort-of deal from Marvel. A grave disappointment. I'm scarred for the creativity of this generation, and the ones   after. This stuff is as dry as dry can get."
""
"The length of this film is something tortuous. Every single minute felt like an hour. It was painful to watch, and I'll try not to watch it again, though I was wrangled into watching it again, barely, with my mother, and it was not as entertaining as the first time. It was still a disappointment. I was hoping that maybe, as time went on, that maybe it was just my mood configuring my taste on the film? Maybe it was one of those where it takes multiple tries to like and enjoy it? But no. Even if it is, I will NOT deliberately choose to sit down and watch the film again. It is not worth it. This is the worst Marvel film ever."
""
"I like different stuff. Different movie formats are something that I enjoy, take pride in, and love about movies. This may have been different for Marvel, but surely, I have something better to do than waste another three hours on the knock-off Justice League taking their little time travel adventures that are way too predictable that it hurts or are so outlandish with their answers that it makes me laugh and feel like I'm just wasting my time. At the film, not with it. The jokes in this film are... well... I do not believe that this movie has jokes."
"This movie is bland, and things just tend to... happen, with little-to-no explanation(s). This film just seems as if though production just had a bunch of sticky-notes lying around like, ""Put this into the movie because we NEED to, otherwise fans would attack us,"" and ""No, we need to stay true to the comics!"" I can't imagine how much bickering that went on whist making this movie. They had a time limit, I can tell. This movie sucks."
""
"I could go on, and on about why this movie is awful, but, quite simply, to keep it straight, for every success comes five failures, and with this new phase of Marvel, all their long, over-due mistakes are coming back again, and to bite them, as they tend to always do. All in all, in the end, like every other mistake, there was a lesson to be learned. And that lesson was to not, just NEVER let an inexperienced director have control over practically every aspect of a multi-million-dollar film/production. I'm sure that Marvel has learned their lesson after this mess of a film, that deserves no other viewer to watch. And if they don't, then they SHOULD."
""
So:
""
"AVOID, WATCH THIS CRAP AT YOUR OWN RISK. You have been warned. Don't make this mistake as I have. You MUST have something better to do than watch this, certainly. Go and like, watch something else better, just don't watch this."
""
""
""
P.S.
"Also, too many characters that are just there to be... there. They aren't interesting, none of them are. I wish they were, though, as most of the interesting things this movie has to offer are just, glanced over. Too much potential, the execution just sucked. This movie could have been better if they just allowed it to be. New critical low. Now when I see a bad movie, I always comment, ""Almost as bad as Eternals,"" registering the movie as a mistake to cinema history and a pinpoint for what NOT to do going forward."
"Despite the fact this this movie is ""educational,"" it still isn't worth living through. Not once, nor twice, nor three times, you better just watch something else. Possibly nothing, maybe eye damage isn't what you crave after all."
"Well made, if a little too full of new characters. Effects at the end with the Unimind could have been better. Great to see a movie that was actually filmed on locations"
"Loved it , loved all the different characters and their unique super powers."
"Really slow pacing. Could've been better, and the action wasn't until towards the end."
It was an OK movie I fell asleep during the first 30 minutes the first time I watched it but the 2nd time I watched it and I felt like it wasn't as bad as people made it seem so overall I give it 5/10
"The storyline is interesting enough for a comic book movie but where this film lost me is in its super, in your face wokeness and hellbent inclusion. I can‚Äôt believe this is where we are. Good luck with all that Marvel, I‚Äôm out."
"Film noioso, personaggi insulsi e fastidiosi. Trama quasi inesistente e forzata"
"Tranne l'interpretazione totalmente fuori ruolo dalla Jolie, il film √® strutturato bene. Nonostante fossi partito prevenuto, giudico buona la cabina di regia di Chlo√© Zhao e interessante la costruzione dei personaggi. Buona messa in scena, ottima la fotografia."
What a mess.. all of the criticism for this is valid
"Gostei bastante do filme ele foi o tipo de filme que fez eu ficar muito empolgado assistindo e mais empolgado ainda querendo um eternos 2, o elenco achei perfeito, o √∫nico problema √© que ele acaba ): preciso de um eternos 2 urgenteeeeeeee"
"Tried to watch three times but was too bored, confused and uninterested."
Great action movie. Loved the historical aspect. A great introduction to the new characters.
Me gusto bastante la historia es entretenida y los personajes son de lo mejor ademas el reparto es de lo mejor
A score of negative five stars would still be too high for this monstrosity. Zero stars is more appropriate. How far Marvel has fallen.
Es buena y diferente.
"I'm sorry to the director of Eternals, but seriously Chloe Zhao, did you make this film for fun?"
"They made their goal, pure inclussion but no adventure and no coherence."
"I am disappointed with the plot of the story that is presented, it should be a more interesting first film."
Eternals is beautiful. One of the most complex and unique Marvel films. My personal favorite. A tale of gods choosing humanity over dogma.
Only the celestials scenes were worth watching everything else was blah
zzz

"falls under the weight of its own ambitions,"
Pire film de marvel les personnage ne sont pas int√©ressants et l'histoire qu'elle merde. Lol
"I did not see the movie in the theater, because the advertisement did not move me. I just watched it on Disney + and I must say that I am glad that I did not waste my money. The movie had no energy to it. It just rambled on and on. The story line did not provide the viewer with any way to be emotionally invested in any of the characters. So sad, because I really wanted to like the movie."
"Embora o filme n√£o seja ""perfeito"" ele √© um dos acertos que a marvel precisa insistir para desviar da formula padr√£o da marvel."
"Super underrated, great movie!"
It's a good movie.  Just give it a chance. It's a better Marvel movie than shang-chi. And I standby that.
Definitely thought it was better than what some people thought. The story felt a bit complicated but I really liked how it played out. I really loved the characters and how they all seemed to play a certain role. The way this setup the future of the MCU is awesome and opens the door for so many possibilities.
Massive misfire from the MCU.
"This doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, this movie was not bad but it introduced too many characters to fit in one film. Though it had some awesome scenes, I wouldn't know it was a Marvel film unless the logo was there."
Hands down the worst marvel movie (those actually produced by marvel) that I have ever seen. I loved that they varied the cast with different ethnicities and there were some big stars. But the story was disjointed and the ending that shows they are just robots was bizarre and not like the comics at all. Additionally some questionable content put into a move aimed for kids to see as well. So disappointing because it could have been great. Also doesn't make sense at all that they never showed up to help in any big events. I don't care if they were told not to interfere.
"After Shang Chi da marvel returns with a new group of superheroes linked to great beings of the MCU, and a good movie even though the story was dragged and tiring, with great visual effects and a photography show"
"I was pretty pleased with Eternals. I actually did not watch it for quite some time after release and had low expectations because of reviews and things I had heard. I think it's a great addition to the MCU and I was captivated by all the characters who I had just met, which is no small feat. I am excited to continue this storyline in future MCU projects!"
"With such a fabulous cast, this should have been better. I know that many people would say this is not supposed to be a Marvel movie in the classic sense, but that doesn't excuse it being so painfully uninteresting."
I appreciate the courage (taking a different take on the Superhero genre) of Marvel Studios and The Director's Vision for this Film.
"This was one of those rare circumstances where being familiar with the source material made the movie better, not worse, because knowing who the eternals, celestials, and deviants are coming into the movie enhanced my enjoyment of it. Without that knowledge, the movie would have been confusing."
Wow I loved this new Star Wars remake. Starts of with the slow roll text with a triangle ship and then panning down to a planet. Wait this wasn't Star Wars
Though the potential for a good film was there. It was executed terribly. None of the characters were even remotely likeable because they were all so stiff and uninteresting. There were great concepts and ideas the were never expanded on. I felt so bored while watching this movie.
"Eternals is, essentially, a movie about the confrontation of the creation with it's creator, both in front, with the protagonists and the Celestials relationship, and behind the cameras, in this unconformity between Zhao's cinema and the Marvel formula, and it's exactly in this that resides the biggest strength and weakness of the picture."
"This is a bad movie in every way. Cast is bad, script is bad, acting was bad, cgi was bad."
I am easily entertained and this even disappointed me.  Sloppy writing.
"Visually stunning, awesome production design, best casting, emotionally rewarding movie with very ambitious and grand scale of the story lands perfectly. Seeing these reviews just screams 'give me generic marvel movie where I cheer every 10 mins' to me. This is an epic standing on its own and a must watch."
"It's not for everybody but it can satisfy hardcore fans. Eternals is a probably a story from the deepest archives of Marvel. As the MCU is trying to follow up their blockbuster success Phase 3, this movie seems to be okay on connecting all the details and also making it easy to understand for new viewers. It's amazing CGI and great cinematography really stands out with it's unexpected twists and one of the best action sequences ultimately completes the whole package."
How I evaluate a movie...
Simple questions I ask myself:
1) Would I pay to see the movie again? (Answer = No)
""
2) Would I watch the movie again for free and I had nothing better to do? (Answer = Maybe)
""
3) Do I regret watching it?  (Answer = No)
""
4) Do I feel the directors /writers either are worthless or had to actually work hard at screwing up a movie that otherwise would be hard to screw up? (Answer = Not intentionally)
""
5) Would I recommend others to go see it? (Answer = probably not in the theater or if your paying to watch it)
"Such a terrible storyline, bad acting and worse focus on mental issues, trying too hard to focus on political interest than a good story. First ever marvel film, (apart from captian marvel) that I thought was a waste of time, I had more fun at my grandparents funeral than watching this."
"Not the best MCU film, in fact very in-MCU in its tone (which was a refreshing change) I found it more enjoyable that some of the recent MCU films but I seem to be the odd one out there."
Visuals were good. Wasted potential.
This movie is just so beautiful and perfect. It might be different than other marvel productions but it is perfectly done and I loved everything about it.
"Eternals had a lot of potential, with lots of interesting characters and some fun, monsterous villains. But cramming all these new characters and their development, a plot that spans thousands of years, fight scenes, emotional moments, and plot twists into a feature-length movie is an impossible task. While Eternals could have worked great as a Disney+ series, as a movie it is too much in too little time (which is something I never thought I'd say about a three-hour movie that feels like four hours). Though some characters have potential, and the stakes for the MCU are large, some poor choices with the plot make Eternals one of the weaker Marvel movies."
"Terrible movie, too long and the story was confusing."
Two.and a half hours of my life that I'll never get back
"Waste of time. Aside from outstanding visuals, comes off as quite boring and slow. Wasted potential at its best, sadly."
"Rushed from the start this movie was very messy and didn't look too good visually, monsters looked like they had been copied and pasted from halo in the 2000's, Lazy movie and not enough build up to care about all these new hero's"
"Very high quality film, good CGI and visuals are stunning!"
The script is amazing and the characters teaming up again and the twists are significant.
It's a shame the only reason it low rated is because of a gay couple. Marvel fans need help
"It was okay, but had nothing like normal marvel movies have, definitely not the best"
"Directed by Oscar winner Chlo√© Zhao, it has the elements to be good with the casting, the interesting character backstories & the world building it's trying to create, but unfortunately It's nothing more than a bloated mess that deserved to have more time to help it out."
"Pacing issues throughout largely down to the flashbacks killing the mood whenever I felt some sort of investment, some could've have been easily cut & or told in chronological order just to build some sort of connection to the characters without the start & stopping."
Too many plot threads are tacked on & one feeling like it's there to make Angelina Jolie has something to do. With the size of the cast it leaves most of the cast with little to do before or nearly forgotten about leaving me no reason to care whatever happens.
"Sadly the weak link with the casting is Kumail Nanjiani, just felt like he was hired to be the terrible comic relief before disappearing from the film as quick as he reappeared."
It was really good besg cgi in a marvel movie ever. Okay plot but the characters and there development are great. Most of these reviews are just people being homophobic Give it a watch!
Bad in every way. Not worthy of being called a marvel movie.
Movie had potential but some of the good characters displayed hateful behavior and I didn't find the movie believable (even in superhero movie terms).
"Slow,boring and plodding. Only redeeming qualities were the special effects."
"Not one of the MCU's best films, it's way too long, the screenplay makes no sense, but the visuals, themes, and Chen's performance are at least a good thing about this movie"
Karun made this movie 1.5 out of 5 and not a 0 out of 5 im trying to say this movie would be dog without him
"Filled with political and social symbolism.  Very ""woke"" and many things forced.  Every time I got pulled into the movie, some ""social"" message slapped me in the face, and could not enjoy the movie."
"Aburrida, sin mucho sentido, un panfleto LGBT, para variar, en lugar de una pelicula de super heroes."
the worst thing i have ever watched
Storyline gets confusing sometimes. Also some questions left unanswered.
Still question why this was even a made. Terrible story line and kind of hard to follow
78/100

Don't listen to the critics on this one because it is a visually beautiful marvel spectacle with awesome fight sequences and hard action and intriguing elements that make this movie absolutely awesome. It is slightly more emotionally detaching than it wants to be but has enough emotional intrigue to touch you by your soul. The cast is awesome and Chloe Zhao brings justice to a marvel movie with her unique and different aspects. Doesn't feel like a generic marvel movie and feels awesome to watch. Sometimes can be lengthy and tedious with a lot of information crammed into a movie but it's fun and interesting and an awesome movie.
"I wanted to like this movie, but I immediately noticed the many flaws the movie has. The plot is all over the place, and it introduces a lot of characters and concepts that it all becomes confusing to me. The runtime for this movie shouldn't be that long. It gets really boring for many moments due to its slow buildup to the climax. I get what they are trying to do here and I see this movie's potential. But the execution was not great. This is not the worst MCU movie, but it's not very good either."
Angelina has not shown any respect.....I advice all not to watch the movie to teach the company a lesson.
you cant introduce so many new core characters in a single film
"Boring as all hell. No real character development, no true investment in any character. Also there is to much pandering going on in the movie, first of all the gay scene was so forced that it was cringe. They could have done a much better job in creating a gay couple instead of look at me this is a gay scene just to get the gay communities off our back. It was a week attempt at appeasing the community and honestly is a insult."
Spoiler!
"""Eternals"" is definitely not a bad movie as many people say. Certainly the amount of flashbacks throughout the movie is the cause of some pacing problems. There are also some exaggeratedly long fight scenes, like the one in the Amazon. But despite that, ""Eternals"" is an extraordinary and unique movie. Chloe Zhao created a beautiful and poetic movie without losing the essence of the superhero classic stuff. Also, the casting is absolutely perfect. Angelina, Gemma, Richard, Barry, Lauren, Salma, Kumail, Lia and Dong-Seok are so great in their roles that they have made me feel like they really have been a family for thousands years. In addition, it is just surprising to realize how well presented these ten (yes TEN) new characters were, even in such a short time for some of them. Druig, for example, doesn't even have 10 minutes of screen time and his complex and controversial personality was really well summarized. The same goes for Phastos and Makkari, who are also not among the main characters, but their essences are so well explained that they don't feel like distant and unknown characters. Furthermore, one of the highlights of the movie is Ikaris and Sersi relationship; they're such contrasting characters and, because of that, their relationship is beautiful. Moreover, although the plot twist was very surprising, it was very coherent; despite the love that Ikaris felt for Sersi and his family, the priority of his existence has always been to fulfill Arishem's will. It is touching to see him suffer for his attitudes and to realize that his greatest flaw is his vehement and blind faith in his supposed essential purpose. He's an extremely staunch and controversial character and despite his death (which beautifully references the legend of Icarus), I hope to see him in the movie sequel; I'm excited to seeing all of the Eternals again (including Harry Styles' Starfox!). Finally... ""Eternals"" is a simple introductory movie, which introduces great new characters to the MCU extremely and surprisingly well. It does not propose grandiosities like ""Endgame"" or ""Multiverse of Madness"", but it is very well executed, has amazing shots and great lines."
"I hope this is the high-water mark of the superhero era and that it is all down hill from here.  This movie was a mess of history, fantasy, and poor writing."
"Isn't perfect, but is awesome. I liked a lot!"
"Film vide, sans but r√©el et sans int√©r√™t a la fin. Trop de personnage, mal d√©fini et jou√© par des acteurs blaser ou sans talents...."
""
"fin de la vraie saga de Marvel ! bienvenue dans la nouvelle √®re , peux int√©ressante, remplit de politique et messages mal int√©gr√© .."
"They killed Gilgamesh, the best character imo"
They started making end of the world movies to early and it just felt boring.
"""Eternals"" follows a distinct formula compared to most other films a part of the MCU, due to which the plot unfortunately becomes messy at certain points. On the bright side the action sequences, incomparable visuals, and memorable performances by Angelina Jolie and Lauren Ridloff prevent the film from being a total letdown."
It's a great disappointment dat the human race reach such Moral Decay due to your moral mental illnesses . Even Animals have a common sense ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The MCU had it's first stinker
Does not worth your time
"Not one of the strongest MCU movies... perhaps once there's more puzzle pieces of the next saga of MCU movies, this one will improve a bit, but the movie suffered from the audience having a lack of a strong connection to all these new characters being introduced, which kinda sucked the emotion out of scenes that probably should've been more impactful.  That said, the cast still did a good job, and it certainly is a game-changer in several ways for the MCU moving forward.  Still could've cut the movie down length-wise though, and the CGI was actually not at the level of quality I'd expect for Marvel at times.  End credit scenes are very good though, looking forward for what's to come!"
too long and honestly kinda a slog to get through
"Critic score is false and BS. Decent film with big name actors. Very different to your standard MCU film. Stunning like most say with tons of real light, beach sun and sunsets but lacks big action. The 2nd one though will be a big time deal. Very Excited."
"What tf was I watching, it makes no sense and if you stop and think about it the implications of the movie negates the impact and importance of humanity. Cringe"
Druig and Makkari stole the entire movie for themselves.
"This movie was just boring. Like how they accomplished that is beyond me. The sheer amount of star power brought to bear in this movie should have left us all feeling wowed! But instead it just seems like all that star power was wasted. I yawned my way through this predictable movie to its very predictable ending. Too bad a movie with this many great actors and actresses in it should have been an easy no brainer block buster. I keep harping on the writers, but man Disney/Marvel needs to get better writers. These lackluster, formulaic, boring scripts HAVE to go."
Didn't mind the slow build-up at all.
"Dumb as could be.   I mean truly dumb. On the bright side, the movie is very inclusive of a lot of different nationalities, races, genders, sexualities‚Ä¶‚Ä¶has a young girl who looks like a boy and maybe is a lesbian which is great for the LBGQTABC+ community, oh almost forgot the black character is a homosexual married to a very handsome Arabic man speaking Arabic to us plus they have a child together. Disney made sure these two guys did some French kissing on the porch for all of us to see. Loved the boldness in that. A bit disappointed they had a nude sex scene on the beach between a man and a woman. The next marvel movie disney puts out should have a sex scene between two men, that is if disney truly wants to be woke. Same sex marriage in da house!  Not sure which one birthed the kid though. Also has a deaf actor signing her lines(I loved this bec not enough deaf people in movies by far), has a couple of folks from India, couple of Asians, Hispanic in Selma hyack (who by the way in a horrible actor no matter the character she plays‚Äîjust being honest) but certainly not enough negros so that's not cool because Disney is supposed to be woke as Duck. Saint george Floyd would not approve.  Overall not a good story line. I wasted my time watching it all the way to the end hoping it would get better but it didn't. This poopy cast of characters should not be intertwined with the other marvel characters as they a not worthy to share their screen. Angelina, why would you degrade yourself signing up for this movie?  Did I mention it was a bad movie? At the end they said the eternals will be back. Not sure I want that to happen, but do love the inclusivity of casting and affirmative action hiring and the total disregard for casting chemistry so they can achieve maximum diversity. It's not about the money it's about social justice causes. I mean who wants to make a movie using the best talent and earn a billion dollars like top gun maverick? Duh, like no one I know.  And lastly hoping Disney puts out a broke back mountain love scene between a couple of alpha males super hero characters in their next marvel movie. If so, they will win the academy award for most woke movie."
Slow movie with bad character development. Why is the ONLY black gay? It didn't add to the story. Overall...CORNY!
Disappointing‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get the hype ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Marvel took quite a risk with this movie, but it greatly scales the Marvel universe as we know it, bringing in characters and entities we never thought we would see in films, but in the comics instead. Understanding all the characters in the Eternals faction was understandably hard to put together and learn about in one film, but Chloe Zhao probably did it in one of the best ways possible to give us the entertainment we expect in a Marvel film. CGI and visuals really were spectacular all in all, and I can say it did carry some weight of the film on it's back. Overall, it is not something that would need a sequel, but it was quite good nonetheless, and a very interesting turn for the future of the MCU."
It is so shit the worst movie ever
So bad I couldn't even finish watching it.
"This cast is amazing, the director is amazing, but the film as a whole falls short. There‚Äôs too much going on while not being enough with plenty of filler. Some questions are answered, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to what we‚Äôve seen before."
"This movie catches too much flack, it's representation of the cosmos was incredible in my opinion and the celestials in certain scenes had very powerful presences, this movie is certainly decent."
"As much as a good filmaker Chlo√© Zhao is, she ultimately created the weakest and worst MCU film which would have probably been better as a 6 episode Disney+ series."
"By far the most boring Marvel movie yet, but still better than anything DC has done in the last 10 years."
"One of the best Marvel productions lately, could be a little overwhelming with all the new protagonist but overall it's a decent Marvel movie"
This is the only movie I went to where I wanted to leave the theater.
"A major departure from what you would normally expect from an MCU film. But this was expected. The visuals are amazing, there's a lot of storytelling and new comic book mythology shared for the first time in the MCU, so be prepared for a lot of unfamiliar stuff. Both halves had their fair share of action set pieces but the final act was maybe a little lengthier than I'd like. Stay back for the mid and post credits scenes!"
"There were some interesting moments and characters in this film, but it was too long and didn't build up enough connection to its long list of cast for the payoffs it wanted. This concept and story would have been better utilized in a series on Disney+ then the big screen."
Goes to show how much in touch critics are. The public has spoken and I agree
it was okay. expected more.
"The style is changed, not so Marvel movie. But cannot be treated as normal one, so the mark is just so so."
The best looking MCU Film. Eternals is a very enjoyable movie. It has one of the best CGI in a film.
This movie has all the ambition but tries too much In one movie
Absolute garbage that does not deserve to be in the MCU. Opening with a text crawl and having a sex scene should disqualify from Marvel right off the bat. Then the movie was awful on top of that
"""Eternals"" is a bad mess, it includes too many subplots and characters."
The CGI is a big step up from Endgame but that's the only thing worth seeing it for
"Ultra boring, worst characters ever, huge plot holes..."
"Non Spoiler: not a bad movie, but not a great one either. Visually it was good, not Avatar level of ‚Äòmust see', but the camera work combined with the visuals was definitely the high point of the movie. Overall, the cast was acceptable as well, with a few stand out interactions. The main issue is there's so many characters and so little time, that by the end of the movie there will be 3-4 people you just don't give a damn about. I can't even remember their names without referring to the IMDB cast list.  My suggestion is wait for this one of Disney plus for free. Don't pay to premium stream it and don't go to the theater for it. It's not worth the extra cash, but can still be a fun romp for the family on a slow Saturday night cuddled up on the couch."
""
On to the spoiler filled review breakdown.
""
Pros
""
"Visually impressive movie. Stellar camera work with atmospheric CGI (we'll cover some of the character CGI in a different section) combine to paint some incredible shots in this film. But as we all know, visuals are only window dressing if the story and characters aren't engaging."
""
"Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee). Fantastic dynamic. Anytime either of them were on screen it was a highlight. Their relationship was beautiful as well. Comrades in arms over several millennia, it's was a closeness not born of romantic interest. Instead it was forged in battle and mutual respect for their abilities as equals. Even better was that as Thena slipped into madness, Gilgamesh never left her, becoming the rock she could depend on in her darker moments and leading to one of the best male/female friendships I've seen in recent cinema."
""
"Kingo. I was really worried about how they were going to treat Kumail Nanjiani. I was afraid they wouldn't play to his natural comedic strengths and suppress his natural charismatic dorkiness. Not so. They went full in on letting him play to his strengths. The fact he choose to become a Bollywood superstar, portraying four generations of male members of his family as leading men lead to some great moments. Even better was his casual attitude when discussing things with his butler and the fact he wants to document the groups adventures thru online media led to some great laughs. He was also a beast of a fighter with strong morals and views on family."
""
"The flashbacks. It was really cool watching these characters as they moved thru history and helped influence significant events and shaped things. Would have been nice to have spent more time on it to establish the lore, but it was done fairly well."
""
"The Celestial Plan. Liked the way they handled and explained what the Eternal's mission was. Granted you don't find out until almost the third act, but it was a solid explanation for those completely unfamiliar or only having a passing knowledge of the source lore."
""
The Meh
""
"Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry). Honestly, if we base it totally on Henry's performance and who his character was in the film, I would consider him a ‚Äòpro'. However, the press up to the release did both the actor and the character a major disservice. If you haven't been following that, Phastos is the openly gay character that has the asshole trolls in an uproar and the fantasy living ‚Äò133' gender people clapping like he's Martin Luther King reincarnated. What's ridiculously sad, is he's a great character. In the film he's basically a ‚Äòtech wizard' and helps humanity as it advances down the path of science. He wants them to grow, but is trying to balance out the passing of knowledge with the danger it presents. This all comes to a head in WWII when the US drops the bombs on Japan. It breaks his character and he truly believes the human race isn't worth saving. But then you see him realize the good humanity offers once he meets his husband and his adopted child. And it was very well done. Not hyped up, in your face, or over exaggerated. They were simply a family. It's just sad that the Hollyweirdos had to boil down the whole character in their press build up to what his sexual preference was. There was way more character depth there."
""
"Ajak (Salma Hayek). Seriously not sure why she was promoted so heavily in the movie. She's in about a quarter of it. As the matron of the Eternals, she's the figurehead who communicates with the Celestials on their mission progress. She's firm, but caring and Hayek does a better than average job. But she's in the initial flashbacks, then dead 5 minutes into the present day. Real let down and what's worse, we had zero connection to her because she's gone so quickly. A death that should have been impactful and heart wrenching is instead barely a blip on the emotional radar. Missed opportunity with the talent and the character."
""
"Sprite (Lia McHugh). Loved the character. She was sassy, well acted, and offered a unique view into the mental stress that being an Eternal trapped in an adolescents body for eternity brings. It was very reminiscent of Kristen Dunst in Interview with The Vampire. Despite some great moments that address this (seriously the discussion of Peter Pan between her and Kingo was fantastic), she was let down by the writing in the end. The pace the film had to move didn't give her the time the character needed for that to be impactful and that's another missed opportunity."
""
"Deviants and fight CGI. Which is surprising when the atmosphere cgi was so on point, there are times the character CGI really lets you down. Blatantly. Especially whenever Thena starts fighting deviants. Was just a strange shift in quality that was very noticeable and immersion breaking."
""
"Druig (Barry Keoghan). Pretty much non-existent in the film. They start an interesting story line where he breaks from the family because he feels like he could prevent humanities atrocities with FB his abilities (mind control). But they never really explore it and the character never really develops. He's simply there, one of the background guys you just can't bring yourself to care about."
""
The Bad
""
"Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sersi (Gemma Chan) relationship. Hands down didn't buy it. You spend the most time with them as a couple but the chemistry just isn't there. What's even more criminal is that it pulls precious time from the more interesting characters. Then at the end they use their love as a reason that lets the good guys win. And because the relationship felt weak, the payoff of that moment was weak. Not sure if it was the actors or the writing, but I'm leaning towards the writing because both of them were fine in their other interactions."
""
"Ikaris power level. Seriously, where is this guy sit as far as his abilities go? It's all over the place. He gets bodied early on by a deviant that Gilgamesh slaps around fairly easily. He's like a simple/less interesting version of Superman, but then at the end we're supposed to believe that he's so powerful he's more than a match for four of the rest of the team. Yet he still gets slapped around handily by each of them SEPARATELY before plot armor kicks in. Richard Madden also kind of phoned in the performance imo."
""
"Pacing. There's a lot of information to cover and more often then not, the story telling leaves you hanging. They often jump from something interesting to something less so as well. All in all, instead of being engrossed in the  movie I was looking at my watch and wondering when it would end. At 2 and a half hours that's not a good vibe for a flick."
""
"Makkira (Lauren Ridloff). Was a super cool ‚Äòspeedster' character with some great moments. But she's in the movie the least. You see her in the beginning and then literally at the climax. She got zero time, zero development, and was ultimately forgettable as a character."
""
"The Marvel formula. Remember early Marvel? When every movie had its own vibe? Ironman, Thor, Captain America, and then the straight quirkiness of Guardians of the Galaxy. Ever since Thor Ragnarok Marvel Studios has followed the same tired formula. Neither movie is unique anymore, just different people going thru the exact same story beats. It's predictable and it doesn't do the source material justice. I'm not sure if it's a director issue or if the suits at Marvel are putting pressure to make it more formulaic, but it's starting to get boring. They need to go back to crafting actually characters and not carbon copies."
""
"The press tour. Everyone and their mother that was involved with the press tour consistently toted the ‚Äòdiversity' and ‚Äòrepresentation' and how it was so amazing. Yeah that's all fantastic, but the movie still NEEDS TO BE GOOD. And all that talk did the characters a disservice. They should have focused on character info, filling in the story, the lore. Then maybe it would have felt a little bit more fulfilling at the end credits. Plus, they aren't the most 'diverse' cast of all time. That still goes to Star Trek Deep Space 9 ages ago. And they wrote amazing stories."
""
"At the end of the day, this is literally a stream only, not even a premium stream. I'd also say, there's not really even enough to entice young kids into this because it's so vague and the characters are so bland. Save your hard earned money for later in the month. Avoid this and only watch it when it drops for stream (not premium) on Disney Plus. Missed opportunity all around."
"Probably the worst Marvel movie to be released so far. It is long, boring, and has an incredibly terrible story. This is the only Marvel movie where I wanted the antagonist to succeed and defeat the heroes."
Just No. did not enjoy this movie. Predictable and wrong wrong wrong choice of actors that played the characters.
I actually thought this movie was done very well. Just none of it mattered at all. Like the Eternals.... Are we never going to talk about the giant dead Celestial in the ocean ever again?
"No tan mala como me la presentaron pero si INCREIBLEMENTE aburrida, me gusta que hayan tratado experimentar pero sinceramente esto fue muy aburrido, vi la pel√≠cula en mi casa con algunos amigos (pague disney+) uno de ellos se durmi√≥ y con el otro trat√°bamos de hacer chistes para mantener el buen ambiente. Aun as√≠, tambi√©n admito que otro amigo lo vio en el cine y si le gusto. Y si, esta pel√≠cula tiene varios huecos de guion como la muy est√∫pida justificaci√≥n de los eternos para no ayudar contra Thanos, el echo de que unos seres super inteligentes decidan enviar robots super inteligentes a un planeta con un objetivo pero que estos robots tengan la capacidad de revelarse, la existencia de un eterno sordo; lo cual me parece absolutamente est√∫pido, etc."
This was a boring movie. I couldn't sit through the movie for a 2nd time. I tried. I'd prefer to watch Mobius tbh..
its sad .
I cant believe its a marvel work. ):
"What can i say about this film. It had a stellar story, the characters were all well introduced to us, gave us a bigger what if scenario for the futre, and overall effects spectacular. I liked how ending gave us a cliff hanger and will we see our three favorites again. Just abosuletly brillant."
This movie was terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  I couldn't bring myself to finish watching the movie.  I love Marvel and Marvel movies.  This was a great big NOPE.  Save your money and save your time...unless you're an insomniac and need something to help you drift off.
"If you weren't a kid who read all of the Marvel Comics series, to make sense of this movie, I would recommend doing what I did and reading abut the plot and characters on it's Wikipedia page BEFORE watching this flick. It will help you make better sense of it, and add to your enjoyment of the movie! When you can understand what is happening and who the characters are, it's a pretty exciting movie, but otherwise, you'l just be pretty lost."
This movie is beautifully shot.
"–ù–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ - —è –¥—É–º–∞–ª –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Ö—É–∂–µ, –Ω–æ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞ –∫—Ä–µ–ø–∫—É—é –≤–æ—Å—å–º–µ—Ä–∫—É. –†–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É—é –∫ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—É!"
"Horrific. Worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. Uninspiring characters, bad story, no coherence at all."
This movie did absolutely nothing for me. I didn't care about any of the characters and the plot was weird and full of holes.
"If the rest of the MCU is an engaging novel, this movie is a dusty textbook. That's not a problem for many of us, but it is sure to turn others off. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I'm happy to have received my MCU history lesson, but I'm in no rush to see this one again."
""
"One common trait I dislike in some comic book movies is an forced sense of grandeur and importance‚Äîan unearned haughtiness to the storytelling and character portrayal that stinks of someone constantly patting themselves on the back. This movie toes the line into that territory a bit too much for my taste, while also trying to inject the typical MCU humor in a way that, for the most part, is smothered by the heaviness of the rest of the film."
Not bad. It's new method and interesting. But not there yet. The movie had too much mcu plot holes.
Growing up the eternals was not a marvel comic on my radar. Now I know why. Not the most appealing superbeings. Just oay and watchable.

04 July 2022
Have rewatched it and believe its better than I first thought
A terrible movie. I Did not like it.
Awful. how tf was this greenlit?
boring as crap and characters had arcs that were sometimes too long and other characters arcs were rushed so much
This movie feels like nothing. i love all the actors but there is no depth or development because there is so much goin on. a rare fail by marvel
"Great actors but not always great acting. Meh story line, poor quality for Marvel. Predictable in many many ways."
"At first, it suffers from the very D.C.ish problem of throwing a lot of characters at you with no development and asks you to care about them but by the end of the movie, you actually do.  This movie faced the big challenge of coming out post-End Game, where we as an audience said good bye to so many characters that we had grown to love and introduces a new ensemble with no connections to them.  The third act fight is enjoyably creative and I did not see the big twist leading up to it.  Now that I have some familiarity with the characters, I look forward to the sequel."
couldn't made past half an hour
"Hackneyed plot, clich√©d tropes, weighting and pacing issues, acting like kids playing anime"
"While it checks off almost all of the current diversity requirements for a show or movie these days, especially from Disney, the story is trite and not interesting.  I found myself bored for the vast majority of the movie.  It took me a couple attempts to just get through it.  It reminded me of a bad episode of The Boys on Netflix.  I am giving up on Disney and won't subscribe again once my current subscription expires.  They just aren't focused on actually generating interesting, well-written stories anymore."
"Extreme lack of imagination when creating the monsters,,Just not interesting at all to watch the fights between them and the eternals.The eternals come as cocky every time they show their powers against the monsters.Blah‚Ä¶.boring.I only watched the beginning because I saw Angelina Jolie and Salma.Hayek were on it,thought it would be good .You are better off watching the latest Sandra Bulock film ,she chose well on that one."
"To sum this snoozefest of a movie ---- It's boring, it's so long that I left the theater in the middle of the movie, to achieve so little with such a long movie is mind boggling, Let's get through some basic facts, The Celestials are as far as I know the equivalent of god in the MCU, they created the Eternals for one purpose, to kill deviants, AND YET THEY STRUGGLE TO DO THAT, some of their powers are so useless for the ONE thing they were created to do, KILL DEVIANTS, You have a girl with super speed, another who can change things into any material she wants (like rock into metal) some guy that can control people, and a KID who can shapeshift, HOW CAN YOU KILL A DEVIANT (which is a big monster) WITH SHAPESHIFTING, (the other Eternals have powers they can actually use to kill the deviants) Also I don't know what the celestial, was smoking when he created the eternals, but they are defective as HECK, the superspeed girl is mute, why, they're literally ROBOTS, why did this celestial made a mute eternal, why? Angelina Jolie's eternal ""glitches"" and she attacks her friends because she remembers something, I don't know I was too annoyed with this film, and some eternal in the body of a kid (sprite I think was her name) I mean why did the celestial create the most useless eternal ever, a kid robot who can shapeshift,anyways, the eternals were made to kill deviants, protect humans, they're immortal, you see them throughout historical periods saying the same thing ""PeOPLe ArE EvIL"", and this is what destroys the movie it's just a bunch of people saying the same thing ""PeOPLe ArE EvIL"" like a broken record, and they don't add anything to it, they don't offer a solution, they just COMPLAIN, one of the eternals who can control people, is basically a mascot for this ""PeOPLe ArE EvIL"" philosophy, he even leaves to make his own community where he control the people there, it's just a mess, one of the eternals (Ajak) die and it's really confusing because they show her dying and then they jump to some random historical period where you see her alive and well,the problem is basically that the world is going to be destroyed because celestials are supposedly born form planets, so they want to save the human race (even though ""PeOPLe ArE EvIL"") the movie has one guy who is basically the comical relief of this very ""intense movie"", all the jokes he makes are just plain bad, as far as I know the movie asks itself questions that it never answers, like why is sprite a kid (the shapeshifting eternal) she also apparently likes another eternal who is basically everything superman shouldn't be, there's also this one scene where a deviant sucks the power of one of the eternals and then he evolves and makes some ""woke"" statement about how the deviants where hunted and were brought near to extinction, and because of that he swears to hunt down all the eternals, even though they were just protecting the EvIL HuMaNs that the deviants were KILLING, this is also the third fight scene in a movie that is two hours and a half long and this was in the middle of the movie, at this point I was so tired and annoyed that I left the theatre so the rest of my knowledge of the movie is based off what people say about it on google reviews, apparently the whole thing where the celestial is about to be born wasn't actually that big of a problem, the real problem is when one of the eternals become evil out of the blue, the director probably wanted to go full M Night Shyamalan and create some unpredictable twist, but in the end it was probably really anticlimactic and boring, which is basically the whole film, boring, asks itself questions it doesn't answer, makes stupid points, and has a bad anticlimactic twist. Don't waste your time, even Morbius is better."
"The OK-est Marvel Movie. One of the most ambitious‚Äîconceptually-speaking‚Äîbut also the least compelling, as far as writing, and then in-turn, delivery goes. These actors could've done better, and most have. At least the treatment for the Celestials was pretty fascinating."
"Fresh marvel movie with beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great characterizations, and an interesting and morally complicated plot."
"This movie really breaks the mold of the average marvel film and provides something that is actually complex and thought provoking. It's and adaption to a relatively uncommon comic book which arguably is better than the source material. It's action isn't too shabby either, with one of the best super-speed fight scenes every made."
"While there are a few issues, but none that hurt the movie too much. It's one of the best marvel movies to just watch independently, hardly effected by the greater mcu."
Truly a beautiful and unique movie if you have the attention span for it.
"it's like they've put together the story of an entire universe in a single 2 hour movie, that's sad! But it's a movie that entertains, I recommend it!the characters don't have time to have a proper development, the script keeps mixing between past and present,CGI manages to go beyond the meaning of perfection, it's extraordinary! A truly beautiful film, with several contemplative scenes... The script is very rushed, Honestly, I thought this movie was amazing! It manages to escape a lot from the so-called ""Marvel Formula"" in addition to bringing characters in which you connect with them,"
"This movie is definitely one that fairs better with a second watch. The storylines and characters take a little time to digest and unpack. This movie is definitely different from other MCU movies. It's heavily character driven and is more about the relationship dynamics within a family and how they react to a question of morality and the greater good than a superhero movie with a clear cut ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". It is amazing that this movie can portray so many distinct characters and opinions on the same problem in such a way that you can discern everyone's motivations clearly and easily despite the number of characters sharing the screentime. The movie is not without flaws, and may have been better served with a full 3 hour run time or even a limited series on Disney +, but it is gorgeous and well told and well acted for what it was."
couldn't even finish it; it's a terrible cash grab with poor acting and bad writing.
Muito bom.
"Primeiro filme da marvel que tem um ar mais adulto, e gostei muito da ideia de que ningu√©m est√° ""errado"" no filme, recomendo e espero a parte 2."
"This film had everything to be one of the best of Marvel Universe, but the story it's just some ordinary super-hero content. The direction was REALLY GOOD, but characters and line were ""OK""."
"Rather long and had a few spots that I wished I had a fast forward button for, that being said I did see it  multiple it multiple times at the theater."
"I liked the juxtaposition of the ""good guys"" aren't really all that good once you know their true mission and the ""bad guys"" have some just grievances based on their back story so they are really that bad. As I delve deeper into the headlines and read multiple news sources I find the same thing happening in the everyday world around us. I spent many years in the military and you never really got told why you were doing a particular deed only that it needed to be done to protect your family."
I think this movie was good enough for a sequel and I would go see it I just hope that it is shorter or that the pacing is better.  There are plenty of opportunities to go to the bathroom and not miss much on the screen.

"this film brings a fresh interesting character, but its like had a rush on its plot. For some characters, they don't get introduced well."

"One of my favorite Marvel movies! It was an amazing change of pace from the ""Marvel formula"" we have come to know. It was much more character/emotion driven than others and it was refreshing!"
"the actors are amazing, but te writing is tiring! still can't believe they waited this long to bring Angelina Jolie to the Marvel universe and ended up doing this to her."
"One mess of a movie, mainly because of too many characters - I just didn't care about any of them!"
""
"In my opinion, they should have focused on maybe two characters at most, fleshing out their backstories. They could have gotten away with just making mention of the other characters, and later introducing them in the sequels."
Better than Doctor Strange 2
Bad story bad characters only 3 where likable and rest where annoying there only 2 action scenes in the whole movie the only thing I liked was when the end credits started to play. Hi
i mean not to accuse but ikaris is totally a rip off of superman which is not like marvel to copy DC and the whole plot of the story just confuses the MCU. Making it look like Thanos was the good guy
"I saw this twice hoping to enjoy it more the second time. Sadly, I liked it less. On the first watch I think my excitement to be back in the theater really set me up to be disappointed so I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. I just didn't connect with many characters here or really care about their story as much. I think it tries a little too hard at times and I just prefer superhero movies that are fun and action packed as opposed to a long drama. I did really enjoy the twist villain however, which might be way it lost some points on re-watch. 6/10."
Complete and total garbage. Just awful. Save 2 hours of your life and avoid.
"Very forgettable characters, and the story was very boring. Only thing that was cool were the deviants and celestials"
I liked it but I couldn't pay attention in scenes with Druig because his posture is so bad he stands so stupidly I couldn't help but laugh. Also Harry Styles?
"I don't get why this movie is this hated. Hear me out, it has its flaws: there are a LOT of flashbacks, around 30% of this movie is like backstory (at least that's what it felt like). The second flaw is the pacing. This movie was very slow, and I know this will ruin it for some people, but not for me. I don't mind slow burns, and this kept me invested enough to finish it. It didn't ruin it for me, I actually liked it, but it might not be for you. Also, the ending is kinda meh. It was a little disappointing, and this is the biggest flaw in my opinion. Some of the characters were good, like sprite, but some are bland, like Sersi."
"But, all that said, this was still a good watch. It has some great scenes, and the fights may be over the top, but some of them were kinda epic."
"This is definitely not a masterpiece, but it's not the worst we've seen in the MCU."
"6/10‚Äè‚Äè‚Äé. Edit: Ok so I found a GREAT review video, with a lot of good points, give it a watch: https://youtu.be/AM2V6wSHwE4"
"This is where Phase 4 confusion starts, this movie does not know what it is trying to deliver, what is its mission, and how well it fits in the MCU. I feel the story is stale, the editing is janky, and the characters are all over the place. Very rough!"
"Fresh, best MCU phase 4 movie so far!"
o inicio nao e muito bom mas o final e interesante
Could've been better and should've been better. So much potential wasted. Would've worked better as a series
"Gemma Chan is hot.  Salma Hayek is also hot.  That's all I took from this movie.  Other than those facts, this movie did not need to be made.  If you skip this, you won't be missing anything from the MEU"
Terrible movie!  No plot and the characters don't make any sense.  Woke Disney is ruining Marvel.  They haven't produced a good movie since they got the license.
One of the worst and most convoluted movies I have ever seen.  Does not live up to the Marvel standard.  At least the sequel will be better because you cant get much worse than this.
"nonsensical motivation and logic from a boring batch of ""characters"" facing off against generic supervillain #8. Star wars prequal like relationships where all the main cast claim that they're family, but then show no scenes of them bonding or actually feeling like they love and care for each other. And the biggest sin this movie commits is killing off my lord and saviour, Don Lee. I know I just gave a spoiler, but who actually cares about spoiling ""The Eternals"""
It was a good movie! Don't depend on critics
"This film tries to do too much at once, trying to cram a miniseries worth of themes and ideas into a two and a half hour motion picture, ultimately achieving neither. Chlo√© Zhao may have also been a poor choice for director as the documentary style she's known for may not line up with the¬† tone that MCU fans have grown accustomed to. Perhaps that was the intention, but it did not pay off."
"Good, not great."
""
But no where near as low as the hate its getting.
""
"Just good, and does a good job of moving the MCU story forward."
Marvel taking risks and exploring new ways to tell these stories is straight up admirable. Very glad they allowed Chlo√© Zhao to be the first to step out of line - her singular way of filming makes the movie stand out.
Were there some pacing and writing issues? Perhaps. But the visual and poetic spectacle Zhao gave us made these issues go away.
Perfect! and the scenes were breath-taking.
Well done movie. Amazing actions. Fights of the powerful beings
I can't be bothered watching the last hour- wish there was some reason to care about these characters. BRILLIANT ACTORS. so so script.
Every character shines on their own way and the mcu takes a big leap and I think it really pays off as something different so we don't get sick of the same things
This is the next level of bullshit
Eternals on todella tyls√§ ja litte√§ kokonaisuus. Kerronta on sy√∂p√§√§. Sankarijoukko on ep√§kiinnostava ja juoni huonompi kuin pocahontas 2.
"So long, repetitive & makes you feel glad when it's finally over"
Better than expected.. Had it's ups & downs but overall a good watch..
"Per presentare 10 personaggi forse sarebbe servito un film un pelo pi√π lungo, per tutto il resto nulla da dire"
"Sin duda algo distinto a lo antes visto en Marvel, con excelentes interpretaciones y efectos especiales llamativos, pero en cierto punto se vuelve algo lenta y te sobre explican las cosas."
"Up until now, the most confusing movie in the MCU, currently the worst Marvel movie ever made"
I loved the movie except for when they are talking in the first part of the movie the captions just overall were not on the screen long enough and that goes for when they put the captions up telling what the woman signed in sign language
"It is shocking how bad this film is. The story is painfully slow and boring, as the Eternals spend almost the whole movie getting together. The characters, with the exception of maybe Kingo, are all one dimensional and don‚Äôt get enough time to be developed (including the main character who does barely anything in the movie). The movie gets somewhat woke at times, which disappointed me personally. The CGI is okay, but bad by MCU standards. Overall, the move is a shallow mess and it‚Äôs embarrassing this came from the MCU."
"Idk why the others rated this fil. So low but honestly, this is wayyyyyyy better than Spiderman no way home!"
"As a long term Marvel fan i hate that they are constantly bringing new higher powers to the universe, first it was the avengers, than aliens and now some kind of celestial beings. It makes the avengers useless and meaningless. But the Story on it‚Äòs own was nice and the special effects, i‚Äòm just going to act like it isn‚Äòt a MCU movie"
Wow finally something interesting and fresh from Marvel. Too bad most of that is marred by the grotesque amount of poor CGI that accompanies every Marvel iteration. How much revenue does Disney take in and they don't do CGI its justice in 2022? This depresses 2009 James Cameron.
"It was an incredible work of art. As an LGBTQ latinx, it felt extremely comforting to see people like me on screen, especially with such  important and raw roles in the MCU UNIVERSE. Cheers to that! And long love diversity!"
"What a waste. This movie would have worked way better as an episodic Disney Plus release to have these characters and stories more fleshed out. This movie is boring, and has no character at all."
"I didn't like this movie because it brought weak action, an unnecessary sex scene on the beach and mainly because of the first gay kiss (also unnecessary)."
Love the change of pace and the new world we get to explore with these diverse characters.
It was kind of.. irritating? Still a fun movie tho but some choices they made with that were wack
Doesn't stream I couldn't even watch the movie at theater because I had to go use the restroom at least keep movies running in theater 1 month then next bring it in stream next month and terrible movie
Pretty choppy story but not without its enjoyable moments.
Not an earth shattering entry into the marvel universe.

"Wasn't very well paced, never shown how or what the characteristics of each character are they just spout constant exposition on each other. Terrible movie given the budget. The half star is for all the valuable social and political lessons I can quickly forget about."
Well its not bad but not that good either. I mean it's like another movie with Marvel's recipes.. just don't feel much connection to the character and story line
This movie is too rushed to introduce the characters
"Due to the fact that it was advertised as the most inclusive Marvel movie, they trusted that only for that reason it would be a work of the 7th art, neglecting the main plot. This is more reflected in the fact that if the main offending is removed, it would not create any conflict with the rest, (I am not saying that because being inclusive is bad, but if you do not know how to implement it well, it results in several errors in this movie, such as the aforementioned)."
garbage it was the worst marvel movie other from the new mutants
"unexpected, magnificent, I was delighted with the way the film escapes the marvel formula, presenting a tightly tied plot and with a bright future for a next film."
Eternals was by far my favourite Marvel film and hearing such harsh critiques prompted me to provide a rating! The ensemble cast had the pressure of bringing new characters to life on the big screen. I think the calibre of talent allowed those watching to sit back and enjoy the ride. It was visually stunning and told an epic story across thousands of years. I was captivated from start to finish. Character development and storytelling (including the connected mythology) at it's finest! I was left wanting more.
"A slightly suffocating film that pulls you in for a long time without anything interesting, but good characters with huge potential for sequels and great actors."
Can't believe it's a movie from Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Not something at all.
"The director took it upon themselves to rewrite a good part of the Eternals mythology into a tedious start to the story.  Then you find out they are robots, and from that point, it makes no sense and you don't care about the characters.  They're robots‚Ä¶"
""
"Good gifted actors in a beautifully shot movies, burdened by a poor script and choppy contradictory story line.  Thank goodness I got it from the library and it cost nothing.  And thank goodness for the fast forward button."
"couldn't get through this. it was a little weird for me, but mostly just really boring"
"I love the fact that I did not see any cheap gimmick in this MCU movie like the other movies, *cough cough* (Avengers). I don't understand the negative reviews cus I loved it. Angelina Jolie was an actual goddess here and I might actually go see an MCU movie at the theatres when the next Eternals comes out!"
"Great potential but painfully PC that ruined the movie. Like so many movies and shamefully marvel is falling into it, the movie has character types and stereotypes that weren't in the original and take away from the actual story just so disney can push political agendas on kids."
"Es una pel√≠cula diferente a lo que Marvel nos a ense√±ado en cuanto a superh√©roes, no es tan din√°mica como otras pero es muy buena y el final es atrapante, cada batalla es estupenda sin tanto movimiento y a√∫n as√≠ dinamica"
"Roteiro furado, n√£o me pareceu um filme da qualidade da marvel, ""desconexo no universo da marvel"". Conseguiu ser pior que Capit√£ Marvel. N√£o curti."
"Buena historia, para disfrutar."
I made an account specifically to leave a rating for this movie. I can get on board for not liking a movie and moving on in life but in this case if...

"You end up fighting for a cause you've been told your whole life (thousands of years) is just, realize (in the course of a day) you weren't fighting for the ""good side"" in the plot, then the only option left is to kill yourself?... No one in his ""family"" even seemed to care?... Pretty dark disney... Pretty dark..."
Although it was nice to watch a Marvel movie which is not just a rehash of the same old universe and which was reasonably woke-free for once this movie was unfortunately pretty meh. It is not as bad as many of the detractors claim but it is miles away from being as good as some of those who liked it claims. It is actually pretty meh.
""
On the good side there are some decent special effects but that is more or less to be expected. It is the one thing that Marvel movies usually have going for them after all.
""
It is a fairly serious movie that is not so polluted with comic relief as some of the Marvel movies.

"The story is a interesting one but it is unfortunately a bit wasted by the implementation in this movie. Also, it pretty much screws up evolution from the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as any form of religious theories (not that I am a great believer in those though). But then this is pure superhero fantasy so I'm not too bothered by that."
""
"My main gripe with this movie is that it, as is way to often the case with Hollywood, portrays the Eternals more like a bunch of bickering dysfunctional children than the wise thousands of years old beings that they are supposed to be."
""
"Ikarus in particular is a pure Hollywood asshat. He reminds me of that pervert asshole Homelander in the depraved Hollywood creation The Boys. However Druig and Sprite also grated on me in a lot of the scenes. I never like characters that betray people, stick knifes in peoples backs (literally) and so on."
""
"The movie also felt a bit slow. There was a lot of rather boring filler material between the actual action or advancement of the story, and a shitload of flashbacks. I hate flashbacks but then that is probably personal. To me they just interrupt the flow."
""
"The movie also does not really feel very positive. It ends rather sadly actually. Also, at the end they may have saved Earth but, if the story is to believed, by doing so they prevented billions and billions of beings from ever being created. Not really a win-win is it?"
""
"It is clear that this movie was setting things up for a continuation and, despite my reservations about this one, I think there is a pretty good oportunity to create something decent from this. It all depends on whether they pick a decent write/director or one of the woke Marvel hacks."
"The sudden addition of more absent members to the Marvel team is a little disconcerting, as well as the continuous flicking back and forth between past and present. The plot was highly complicated and reminded me a little bit of the Matrix. The twist was really good in the middle, and the end was sad but pretty cool."
Both the script and the directorship are incredibly poor
"Not sure why the critics bashed this movie. I thought it was unique, interesting, funny at times, and well-acted. It‚Äôs an ambitious and strange movie, but for me it was a welcome departure from some of the MCU norms."
Doesn't stream I couldn't even watch the movie at theater because I had to go use the restroom at least keep movies running in theaters for 1 month then bring it to stream next month and terrible movie
amazing movie. every character was perfectly cast. very comic book accurate
Visually stunning. Almost a standalone that doesn't belong in the MCU. The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. How can something be this ambitious and so intimate at the same time ? A very touching way to deal with the topic of immortality. I don't understand the critic's reviews.
"Visually stellar, has great action scenes for entertainment, and offers plenty of great ideas for a new movie, but inexperienced directing from Chloe Zhao results it to feel like one of the MCU's weaker films."
"I paid an arm and a leg to import this disc from Asia to see it in 3D and I was not disappointed in the 3D conversion as it is excellent and really adds to the presentation. The disappointing part is I really could not get involved with these characters and feel this is the weakest film in the Marvel canon. Just too much info in to short a time and to many self absorbed actors giving banal performances. Just because it's a female director doesn't make it a great of entertaining film, just a politically correct one. Great 3D but Blah otherwise. If only we could get a really entertaining films like Spiderman No Way Home or Luca in 3D but the studios now say no as it's all 4K of nothing."
"The critics have it wrong, this is an enjoyable movie and I hope we learn more about the eternals in the future."
"Infravalorada, aborda una historia de superheroes desde una perspectiva diferente. No es f√°cil presentar tantos h√©roes en una sola pelicula. Lo logra aceptablemente bien"
"Wow, what a stupid waste of time. No fun, no enjoyment...and why does Angelina Jolie always seem to play a crazy b_itch?????"
it was just really bad.
"I didn't watch this movie when it first came out because I heard it was bad anyway, and yeah, I wasn't missing out on much."
"Totally disappointing.  An interesting start but then it seems that the rest was written drunk.  Eternal super heroes with more psycho-emotional problems than humans themselves.  The one who did the casting is useless, let him retire.  Distorted messages where he wants without need.  For a Marvel movie, I don't think it's suitable for children.  An absurd and silly ending."
By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and I'm a big MCU fan). Longest 3 hours of my life and didn't feel a connection to a single character. They could have all died and I would have been happier because the movie would be finally over with no chance of the characters ruining other MCU movies. Terrible. Just terrible. -3000/10
"It tried, but it was okay. It felt like a world building movie, and I look forward to the next film were they actually might do something?"
"I found it difficult to hold my attention. I didn't HATE it, but I think I can honestly say this was my least favorite MCU film."
Very underrated for no reason honestly
A few forced moments do not ruin an otherwise good addition to the MCU. I enjoyed it.
"This movie was.....good...I guess, The best part of the movie was included in the acting, cinematography, and diversity. The bad parts of the movie were included in the hard to understand plot and runtime. This movie should have been a Disney + show, and it would have been 10x better. One thing that was really amazing, was the complex character that is Ikaris. Overall good movie that cured my boredom."
It was good to me don't see why it go so much hate
"Eternals is a work, if I can call it that, somewhat disastrous. It tries to be more than it is, a very slow script, with unsympathetic characters and at best empty. To sum it up: It's a bread sandwich."
"That was painful to watch and get through.  After, what seemed to be 2 hours, I was only at the 45 minute mark.  Beautifully filmed but wow, the plot and character developments were absolute disasters.  I was disheartened to see, after 10 minutes of credits, that there's another installment coming.  Please get the second one right."
"In my opinion, this is the worst Marvel movie to date. The story was poor. None of the characters were interesting or memorable. The whole thing just didn't make a lot of sense. Supposed to be so powerful, but when Thanos is annihilating half the universe, they aren't allowed to get involved? ü§£ü§£ü§£ seriously? The enemies they face are a bunch of monsters that could've been taken from many other movies. They don't speak either. What happened to character development? The movie felt rushed to me. That it had just been cobbled together without any real effort to make it work well.  The casting was wrong. The effects weren't up to the usual Marvel standard. Certain elements were simply put in there for the sake of it. The Blade reference is the only good thing about."
"I felt like the movie was much better than critics were telling viewers. The movie was slow but in a good way. I did feel like it gave enough time with most of the characters to develop and I know that if there is a sequel, it can really build on the mythology. I really liked it!"
"Just, not good. You're unable to invest in the (too many) characters, so conflicts are uninteresting."
"Strange subplots that have no impact, rubbery costumes, and (in my opinion) bad CGI. It's a stain in the MCU."
It isn't offensive... Just really boring and forgettable.
"Not the strongest entry in the MCU, but an enjoyable one"
"This would have made a great mini-series. As it is so much new lore was forced into the movie that it left barely any time to actually care about... well, any of it. Also, you could have completely removed the deviants from the film and I'm not sure anything would have changed. I love Marvel flicks, but this one is objectively bad."
The movie was slow and boring. First Marvel movie I've watch where I fell asleep.
This movie is so forgettable I always forget the name of it.
It's hard to make a superhero movie. It's almost impossible to avoid cheesy dialogue.
"Acting, story, cinematography were all mediocre at best.¬† 5/10"
"Eternals √® stato un film molto criticato, soprattutto perch√® non ci si aspettava una trama cos√¨ complessa per un film di supereroi. Invece proprio la trama √® fantastica, ha permesso di estendere nuovamente il mondo Marvel, aggiungendo nuovi supereroi."
"Simplesmente incr√≠vel em sua nova proposta, uma hist√≥ria incr√≠vel que √© filos√≥fica, contemplativa e emocionante, apresentando o necess√°rio, desenvolvendo muito bem e colocando muitas quest√µes na mesa, √© simplesmente sensacional, com um roteiro e dire√ß√£o lindos e lutas √≥timas, esse filme √© o melhor filme de her√≥i de 2021."
Nota: 94% üçÖ
"I think the movie was the first of getting to know a group of new characters. It gave us a great interesting and engaging start, and it truly gave us something different in the MCU! I enjoyed the movie and look forward to more of the eternals!"
brooo i love this film....honestly they got the best vfx than any other films...the costume design just love it!!!!!!
"Just found the whole concept boring. The a-list cast were sidelined, film was way too long and action scenes were repetitive."
"I love the MCU, but this movie was really disappointing. When I go to a Marvel movie I'm there for the characters above all else so I was disappointed in the shallow characters and lack of character development in this movie. Marvel usually creates deep, complex characters for the audience to fall in love with but the large cast and long timeline of this movie limited the amount of time that got to spend with each character. As a result, none of the characters got the amount of attention needed to make them compelling."
"In addition, the plot was poorly constructed and incredibly lacking in suspense. Marvel needs to stop putting such large threats into minor movies. Perhaps this plot could have worked for an Avengers' movie or if there had been a bit of foreshadowing in other movies but it was obvious that Marvel wasn't going to destroy the entire earth and all of humanity in a smaller film like this."
"The one thing that I really enjoyed in this movie was the beauty of it. The costumes were magnificent, the sets were awe inspiring, and the music was wonderful."
"Is the Marvel movie that have dare to go back beyond time and give the MCU pre-history before ""I am IronMan"" statement open the window to all MCU fans..."
"lousy exposition (show not tell, anyone?), wooden characters, boring action, perfunctory relationships that go no where. i struggled to finish it"
"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Eternals,"" with some of the best special effects seen to date in superhero movies and a shockingly great third act. The acting is alright, though there were a few moments where it lacked. The action was great, the CGI was spectacular to look at, and the worldbuilding leaves you hungry for more. My main issue is how convoluted the story is, where it tries to shove everything it possible can with the shortish runtime down the throat of its viewer. The second act is also the weakest and does get a bit boring at parts. However, ""Eternals"" beautifully introduces this new team of heroes into the MCU and perfectly sets up the future for many potential sequels, even if the cost is an otherwise vague and tiring story."
I downloaded this illegaly and I still want my money back. üñï
Um dos melhores da Marvel ‚ù§Ô∏è
Derivative mush. The worst of what the MCU represents.
worst marvel movie ever
Decent movie wouldn't mind watching again
"Boring movie, bad story. Good visuals and popular names couldn't save it"
Not good at all only some actors were good but they are trying to copy DC please Jeep Marvel straight
